<h2>MARGARET MONTFORT.</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>PRESENT AND ABSENT.</h3>


<p>"It shall be exactly as you please, my
dear!" said Mr. Montfort. "I have no wish
in the matter, save to fulfil yours. I had
thought it would be pleasanter, perhaps, to
have the rooms occupied; but your feeling is
most natural, and there is no reason why you
should not keep your present room."</p>

<p>"Thank you, uncle!" said the girl whom
he addressed as Margaret, and whom some of
my readers may have met before. "It is not
that I don't love the dear rooms, nor that it
would not be a joy to be in them, for some
reasons; but,&mdash;I think, just to go and sit
there every day, alone or with you, and think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
about her,&mdash;it seems as if that would be
easier just now, dear uncle. You always
understand, Uncle John!"</p>

<p>Mr. Montfort nodded, and puffed thoughtfully
at his cigar. The two, uncle and niece,
were sitting on the wide verandah of Fernley
House; it was a soft, fair June evening, and
the fireflies were flitting through the trees,
and one or two late birds were chirping
drowsily. There were only the two of them
at Fernley now, for one day, some two months
ago, the beloved Aunt Faith had fallen quietly
asleep, and passed in sleep away from age and
weakness and weariness. Margaret missed her
sadly indeed; but there was no bitterness in
her grieving, and she felt all the more need
of keeping the house cheerful and bright for
her uncle, who had lost the faithful and affectionate
friend who had been for years like a
second mother to him. They talked of her
a great deal, of the beauty and helpfulness of
the long life that had brought so much joy to
others; just now Mr. Montfort had proposed
that Margaret should occupy the White
Rooms, which had been Mrs. Cheriton's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
special apartments in the great rambling house;
but he did not urge the matter, and they sat
in silence for a time, feeling the soft beauty
of the evening wrap them round like a garment
of rest.</p>

<p>"And what have you been doing all day,
while I was in town?" asked Mr. Montfort
presently. "You were not too lonely, May
Margaret?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not a bit too lonely; just enough
to make it very good to have one's Uncle John
come back. Let me see! After you went, I
fed Chiquito, and stayed with him quite a
while, talking and singing. He is so pitiful,
poor old fellow! Then I took a walk, and
dropped in to see how Mrs. Peyton was; she
asked me to come in the morning, you know,
when I could."</p>

<p>"And how was she? Superb as ever?"</p>

<p>"Just, Uncle John! Her dressing-jacket
was blue this time, and there was a new kind
of lace on her pillows."</p>

<p>"Oh! she has lace on her pillows, has she,
my dear?"</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you, uncle? Pillows and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
sheets are trimmed with real lace, most magnificent.
To-day it was Valenciennes, really
lovely Valenciennes, to match her cap and the
frills on her jacket. And turquoise buttons
and cap-pins; oh, she was a vision of beauty,
I assure you. The pale pink roses on the
table by her bed gave just the right touch to
accentuate&mdash;if that is what I mean&mdash;all the
blue. She is an artist in effects. She must
have been very beautiful, Uncle John? She
is beautiful now, of course, only so worn and
fragile."</p>

<p>"Yes, she was extremely beautiful, in her
way," said Mr. Montfort; "and she was always,
as you say, an artist in effects. And
in a good many other things," he murmured,
half under his breath. "She was glad to see
you, no doubt, my child?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; she is always most cordial and
kind. She made me tell her just how you
were looking,&mdash;she always does that; and
what you were doing."</p>

<p>"Emily Peyton is a singular woman," said
Mr. Montfort, thoughtfully. "She suffers, no
doubt, and I am glad if you can be a comfort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to her, Margaret; but be a little careful, my
dear; be a little careful with Mrs. Peyton!
H'm! ha! yes, my love! and what else did
you say you had done to amuse yourself?"</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle John, do you think I have to
be amusing myself all day? What a frivolous
creature you must think me! I practised
after I came home; and then I had lunch,
and then I arranged the flowers, and then I
made some buttonholes, and all the rest of
the afternoon I sat under the big tulip-tree,
reading 'Henry Esmond.' So you see, I
have really had the most delightful day,
Uncle John."</p>

<p>"Especially the last part of it," said her
uncle, smiling. "Esmond was rather more
delightful than the buttonholes, eh, Meg?"</p>

<p>"Well, possibly!" Margaret admitted.
"He is rather more delightful than almost
anything else, isn't he? But not half so good
as one's Uncle John, when he comes home in
the gloaming, with his pockets full of bonbons
and letters for his unworthy niece."</p>

<p>"Flatterer!" said Mr. Montfort. "Does
this come of visiting Mrs. Peyton? She used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to be an adept in the art. But what do our
two other Margarets say? Has Peggy set the
prairies on fire yet? She will some day, you
know."</p>

<p>"Do you think the mosquitoes would quite
devour us if I brought the small lamp out
here? I really must read you the letters,
and it is too lovely to go in. Shall
I try?"</p>

<p>Margaret brought the lamp, and, drawing
a letter from her pocket, began to read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Darling Margaret</span>:</p>

<p>"I was so glad to get your letter. It was splendid,
and I'm going to copy out a lot of the things
you said, and pin them up by my looking-glass. My
hair <i>will not</i> part straight, because I have the most
frightful cowlick&mdash;</p></div>

<p>"I don't believe you care for this part, do
you, Uncle John? Poor little Peggy's difficulties
are very funny sometimes."</p>

<p>"Why, I like it all, Meg, if you think
Peggy would not mind my hearing it. It
is all sweet and wholesome, I know; but
leave out anything you think I should not
hear."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, there isn't anything, really. I'll go
on, if you like. Where was I? Oh!&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The most frightful cowlick. The reason I tried
was because you said my forehead was nice. I hope
you will not think me very vain, Margaret. And
you know, no one is wearing bangs any more, not
even curly ones. So I have put it straight back
now, and Pa likes it, and says I look like his
mother. Margaret, will you try to get me the receipt
for barley soup, the way Frances makes it?
Mother isn't well, and I thought I would try if I
could make some. I think, Margaret, that I am
going to find something I can really do! I think
it is cooking! What do you think of that? Our
cook went away to her brother's wedding last week,
and Mother was sick, and so I tried; and Pa (I
tried saying Father, but he wouldn't let me!) said
the things tasted good, and I had a knack for flavouring.
That made me feel so happy, Margaret! Because
I had just gone ahead till I thought a thing
tasted right. I did not want to be bothering 'round
with cook-books, and besides, ours was lost, for
Betsy can't read, so there was no use for one. I
made an apple-pudding yesterday, and Pa had two
helps, and all the boys wanted three, but there
wasn't enough, though I made it in the big meat-pie
pan. Darling Margaret, do please write again
very soon, and tell me about everything at dear,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
darling Fernley. How is Chiquito, and does Uncle
John ever speak of me? I miss him dreadfully, but
I miss you most of all, darling Margaret,&mdash;I never
get over missing you. I have a new dog, a setter, a
perfect beauty. I asked Hugh to name him for me,
and he named him Hamlet, because he was black
and white, and Hugh thought he was going to be
melancholy, but he grins and wiggles all over every
time you look at him. I am teaching him to jump
over a stick and he does it beautifully,&mdash;only the
other day I stood too near the looking-glass, and he
jumped into that, and smashed it, and frightened
himself almost to death, poor puppy. Margaret, I
read a little history every day,&mdash;not very much, but
I think of you when I read it, and that makes it better.
Pa says I am going to school next year; won't
that be fun? Hugh is reading 'John Brent' to me in
the evenings. Oh, how perfectly splendid it is! If
I had a horse like Fulano, I would live with him all
the time, and never leave him for five minutes. I
want dreadfully to go out west and find Luggernel
Alley. Hugh says perhaps we shall go some day,
just him and me. That doesn't look right, Margaret,
but I tried writing 'he and I' on a piece of paper,
and it didn't look any better, so I guess I'll leave
it as it is. Do you think I write better? I am trying
to take a lot of pains. I try to think of all the
things you tell me, dear Margaret. Mother thinks I
am doing better, I know. Mother and I have real<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
good talks together, like we never used to before,
and she tells me what she used to do when she was
a girl. I guess she had some pretty hard times. I
guess I'm a pretty lucky girl, Margaret. Now I must
go and get mother's supper. Give lots and lots of
love to Uncle John, and some to Elizabeth and
Frances, and say&mdash;I can't spell it, but the Spanish
thing I learned&mdash;to poor Chiquito. But most love
of all to your own, dear, darling self, Margaret, from</p>

<div class='sig'>"<span class="smcap">Peggy</span>."</div></div>

<p>Mr. Montfort curled his moustaches in
silence for some minutes, when the reading
was over.</p>

<p>"Dear little girl!" he said at last. "Good
little Peggy! So she will learn to cook, will
she? And she is getting hold of her mother!
This is as it should be, Margaret, eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" cried Margaret. "Oh, Uncle
John, this letter makes me feel so happy
about the child. At first, you know, she
missed us all more than she should have,&mdash;really.
And&mdash;and I think that, except
for Hugh, perhaps they did not receive her
in quite the way they might have, laughing
at her a good deal, and sneering when she
tried to make little improvements. I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
mean Aunt Susan or Uncle James, but the
younger children, and George, who must be&mdash;whom
I don't fancy, somehow. And she
has been so brave, and has tried so hard to
be patient and gentle. I think our Peggy
will make a very fine woman, don't you,
uncle?"</p>

<p>"I do, my love. I have a great tenderness
for Peggy. When she is at school, she must
come here for her vacations, or some of them,
at least."</p>

<p>"And she owes this all to you!" cried Margaret,
with shining eyes. "If she had never
come here, Uncle John, I feel as if she might
have grown up&mdash;well, pretty wild and
rough, I am afraid. Oh, she ought to love
you, and she does."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Mr. Montfort, dryly. "Yes,
my dear, she does, and I am very glad of the
dear little girl's love. But as for owing it all
to me, why, Margaret, there may be two
opinions about that. Well, and what says
our Bird of Paradise?"</p>

<p>"Rita? Oh, uncle, I don't know what you
will think of this letter."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't read it, my dear, if you think it is
meant for you alone. You can tell me if she
is well and happy."</p>

<p>"That is just it, Uncle John. She wants
to go to Europe, and her father does not approve
of her going just at present, and so&mdash;well,
you shall hear part of it, at any rate.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Margaret, my Soul!"</p></div>

<p>"That sounds natural!" said Mr. Montfort.
"That is undoubtedly Rita, Margaret; go on!
If you were her soul, my dear, my brother
Richard would have a quieter life. Go on."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Hardly a week has passed since last I wrote,
yet to-night I fly again in spirit to you, since my
burning heart must pour itself out to some other
heart that can beat with mine. It is midnight. All
day I have suffered, and now I fain would lose myself
in sleep. But no! My eyes are propped open, my
heart throbs to suffocation, I enrage, I tear myself&mdash;how
should sleep come to such as I? O Marguerite,
there in your cool retreat, with that best of men, my
uncle,&mdash;yours also,&mdash;a Paladin, but one whose blood
flows, or rests, quietly, as yours, can you feel for
me, for your Rita, who burns, who dissolves in
anguish? Listen! I desire to go to Europe. I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
never seen it, as you know. Spain, the home of my
ancestors, the cradle of the San Reals, is but a name
to me. Now I have the opportunity. An escort
offers itself, perfection, beyond earthly desire. You
recall my friend, my Conchita, who divides my heart
with you? She is married, my dear! She is the Se&ntilde;ora
Bobadilla; her husband is noble, rich, devoted.
Young, I do not say; brilliant, I do not pretend!
Conchita is brought up in the Spanish way, my
child; she weds a Spanish husband, as her parents
provide him; it is the custom. Now! Marguerite,
they offer to take me with them to Spain, to France,
Italy, the world's end. It is the opportunity of a
lifetime. I pine, I die for change. When you consider
that I have been a year here, without once
leaving home,&mdash;it is an eternity! I implore my father;
I weep&mdash;torrents! I clasp his knees. I say, 'Kill
me, but let me go!' No! he is adamant. He talks
about the disturbed state of the country! Has it been
ever undisturbed? I ask you, Marguerite! Briefly, I
remain! The Bobadillas sail to-morrow, without me.
I feel that this blow has crushed me, Marguerite. I
feel my strength, never, as you know, robust, ebbing
from me. Be prepared, Marguerite! I feel that in a
few weeks I may be gone, indeed, but not to Europe;
to another and a kinder world. The San Reals are a
short-lived race; they suffer, they die! My father
will realise one day that he might better have let his
poor Rita have her way for once, when Rita lies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
shrouded in white, with lilies at her head and feet.
Adios, Marguerite! farewell, heart of my heart! I
have made my will,&mdash;my jewels are divided between
you and Peggy. Poor Peggy! she also will mourn
me. You will dry her tears, dearest! The lamp
burns low&mdash;no more! For the last time, beloved
Marguerite,</p>

<p>"Isn't that really pretty alarming?" said
Margaret, looking up. "Why&mdash;why, Uncle

Of course Rita is extravagant, but I am afraid
she must really be very unhappy. Stay! Here
is a postscript that I did not see before.
Oh! Oh, uncle! Listen!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>DOMESTIC.</h3>


<p>Life was pleasant enough for Margaret
Montfort, in those days. The hours were
still sad which she had been used to spend with
Mrs. Cheriton, the beloved Aunt Faith; but
there was such peace and blessedness in the
thought of her, that Margaret would not have
been without the gentle sorrow. She loved
to sit in the White Rooms, sometimes with
her uncle, but more often alone. In the
morning, she generally walked for an hour in
the garden with Mr. Montfort, tending the
rose-bushes that were his special care and
pride, listening to his wise and kindly talk,
and learning, she always thought, something
new each day. It is wonderful how much
philosophy, poetry, even history, can be
brought into the care of roses, if the right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
person has charge of them. At ten o'clock
he generally went to town, and the rest of
the morning was spent in practising, sewing,
and studying; the hours flew by so fast,
Margaret often suspected the clock of being
something of a dishonest character. She was
studying German, with the delightful result
of reading "Der Trompeter von S&auml;kkingen"
with her uncle in the evening, when it was
not too beautiful out-of-doors. Then, in the
afternoon, she could with a clear conscience
take up some beloved romance, and be "just
happy," as she called it, till Mr. Montfort
returned in time for the walk or ride which
was the crowning pleasure of the day. And
so the days went by, in a golden peace which
seemed too pleasant to last; and yet there
seemed no reason why it should ever change.</p>

<p>The morning after the reading of the
letters, Margaret had been in the White
Rooms, arranging flowers in the vases, and
putting little loving touches to books and
cushions, as a tidy girl loves to do, whether
there is need or not. The windows were
open, and the orioles were singing in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
great elm-tree, and the laburnum was a bower
of gold. It seemed really too perfect a morning
to spend in the house; Margaret thought
she would take her work out into the garden,
not this sunny green parlour, but the great
shady garden outside, where the box swept
above her head, and the whole air smelt of it,
and of moss and ferns and a hundred other
cool things. She passed out of the rooms,
and went along a passage, and as she went she
heard voices that came through an open door
at one side; clear, loud voices that she could
not have escaped if she would.</p>

<p>"These table-napkins is scandalous!" said
Elizabeth. "I do wish Miss Margaret would
get us some new ones."</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask her?" said Frances,
the cook, bringing her flat-iron down with a
thump. "The table-cloths is most worn out,
too, this set. Ask her to see to some new
ones. She's young, you see, and she don't
think."</p>

<p>"I've been giving her one with holes in it,
right along this two weeks," said Elizabeth,
"hoping she'd notice, but she don't seem to.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
I thought it'd be best if she found out herself
when things was needed."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Frances, "she's a sweet young
lady, but she'll never make no housekeeper.
She hasn't so much as looked inside one of
my closets since Mis' Cheriton went."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't be over and above pleased
if she looked much into your closets, Frances;
I know that!"</p>

<p>"Maybe I wouldn't, and maybe I would;
but I'd like to have her know as there was no
need of her looking. Don't tell me, Elizabeth!
So long as she could walk on her feet,
never a week but Mis' Cheriton would look
in, and take a peep at every shelf. 'Just for
the pleasure of seeing perfection, Frances,'
she'd say, or something like that, her pretty
way. But if there had been anything <i>but</i>
perfection, I'd have heard from her pretty
quick."</p>

<p>"I think you're hard to please, I do!"
Elizabeth answered. "I think Miss Margaret
is as sweet a young lady as walks the earth;
so thoughtful, and afraid of giving trouble,
and neat and tidy as a pin. I tell you, Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Montfort's well off, and so's you and me,
Frances. Why, we might have had one of
them other young ladies, and then where'd
we have been?"</p>

<p>"I don't know!" said Frances, significantly.
"Not here, that's one sure thing."</p>

<p>"Or Mr. Montfort might have married.
Fine man as he is, it's a wonder he never
has."</p>

<p>"H'm! he's no such fool! Not but what
there's them would be glad enough&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here Margaret, with burning cheeks,
fled back to the White Rooms. It could not
be helped; she had to hear what they were
saying about herself; she must not hear what
they said about her uncle.</p>

<p>She sat down on the little stool that had
always been her favourite seat, and leaned her
cheek against the great white chair, that
would always be empty now.</p>

<p>"I wish you were here, Aunt Faith!" she
said, aloud. "I am very young, and very
ignorant. I wish you were here to tell me
what I should do."</p>

<p>At first the women's talk seemed cruel to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
her. They had been here so long, they knew
the ways of the house so entirely, she had
never dreamed of advising them, any more
than of advising her uncle himself. Frances
had been at Fernley twenty years,
Elizabeth, twenty-five. What could she tell
them? How could she possibly know about
the things that had been their care and
pride, year in and year out, since before
she was born? It seemed very strange,
very unkind, that they should expect her
to step in, with her youth and ignorance,
between them and their experience. So she
thought, and thought, feeling hot, and sore,
and angry. She had never had any care of
housekeeping in her life. Old Katy, her
nurse, who had taken her from her dying
mother's arms, had always done all that;
Margaret's part was to see that her own
and her father's clothes were in perfect
order, to keep the rooms dusted, and arrange
the books when she was allowed to
touch them, which was not often. As to
table-cloths, she had never thought of them
in her life; Katy saw to all that; and if she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
had attempted to suggest ordering dinner,
Katy would have been apt to send her to
bed, Margaret thought. Poor, dear old
Katy! She was dead now, and Aunt Faith
was dead, and there was no one to stand
between Margaret and the cares that she
knew nothing about. Of course, Uncle John
must never know anything of it; he expected
perfection, and had always had it; he did not
care how it was brought about. Surely these
women were unkind and unreasonable! What
good could she possibly do by interfering?
They would not endure it if she really did
interfere.</p>

<p>The white linen cover of the chair was
smooth and cool; Margaret pressed her cheek
against it, and a sense of comfort stole over
her insensibly. She began to turn the matter
over, and try to look at the other side of it.
There always was another side; her father had
taught her that when she was a little child.
Well, after all, had they really said anything
unkind? Frances's words came back to her,
"I'd like to have her know as there was no
need of her looking."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>After all, was not that perfectly natural?
Did not every one like to have good work
seen and recognised? Even Uncle John always
called her to see when he had made a
particularly neat graft, and expected her
praise and wonderment, and was pleased
with it. And why did she show him her
buttonholes this morning, except that she
knew they were good buttonholes, and wanted
the kindly word that she was sure of getting?
Was the trouble with her, after all? Had
she failed to remember that Elizabeth and
Frances were human beings, not machines,
and that her uncle being what he was, she
herself was the only person to give them
a word of deserved praise or counsel?</p>

<p>"My dear," she said to herself, "I don't
want to be hasty in my judgments, but it
rather looks as if you had been a careless,
selfish goose, doesn't it now?"</p>

<p>She went up to her own room,&mdash;the garden
seemed too much of an indulgence just now,&mdash;and
sat down quietly with her work. Sewing
was always soothing to Margaret. She
was not fond of it; she would have read<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
twelve hours out of the twenty-four, if she
had been allowed to choose her own way
of life, and have walked or ridden four,
and slept six, and would never have thought
of any time being necessary for eating, till
she felt hungry. But she had been taught
to sew well and quickly, and she had always
made her own underclothes, and felled all the
seams, and a good many girls will know how
much that means. She sat sewing and thinking,
planning all kinds of reforms and experiments,
when she heard Elizabeth stirring in
the room next hers. It was the linen room,
and Elizabeth was putting away clean clothes,
Margaret knew by the clank of the drawer-handles.
Now! this was the moment to
begin. She laid down her work, and went
into the linen room.</p>

<p>"May I see you put them away, Elizabeth?"
she asked. "I always like to see
your piles of towels,&mdash;they are so even and
smooth."</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked up, and her face brightened.
"And welcome, Miss Margaret!" she
said. "I'll be pleased enough. 'Tis dreadful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
lonesome, and Mis' Cheriton gone. Not that
she could come up here, I don't mean; but I
always knew she was there, and she was like
a mother to me, and I could always go to her.
Yes, miss, the towels do look nice, and I love
to keep 'em so."</p>

<p>"They are beautiful!" said Margaret, with
genuine enthusiasm, for the shelves and
drawers were like those she had read about
in "Soll und Haben." She had loved them
in the book, but never thought of looking at
them in reality. "Oh, what lovely damask
this is, Elizabeth! It shines like silver! I
never saw such damask as this."</p>

<p>"'Tis something rare, miss, I do be told,"
Elizabeth replied.</p>

<p>"Mr. Montfort brought them towels back
from Germany, three years ago, because he
thought they would please his aunt, and they
did, dear lady. Hand spun and wove they
are, she said; and there's only one place
where they make this weave and this pattern.
See, Miss Margaret! 'Tis roses, coming out
of a little loaf of bread like; and there was
a story about it, some saint, but I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
rightly remember what. There! I have
tried to remember that story, ever since
Mis' Cheriton went, but it seems I can't."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, it must be Saint Elizabeth of
Hungary!" cried Margaret, bending in delight
over the smooth silvery stuff. "Why,
how perfectly enchanting!"</p>

<p>"Yes, miss, that's it!" cried Elizabeth,
beaming with pleasure. "Saint Elizabeth it
was; and maybe you'll know the story, Miss
Margaret. I never like to ask Mr. Montfort,
of course, but I should love dearly to hear it."</p>

<p>Margaret asked nothing better. She told
the lovely story as well as she knew how, and
before she had finished, Elizabeth's eyes as
well as her own were full of tears. One of
Elizabeth's tears even fell on the towel, and
she cried out in horror, and wiped it away as if
it had been a poison-spot, and laid the sacred
damask back in its place. Margaret felt the
moment given to her.</p>

<p>"Elizabeth," she said, "I want to ask you
something. I want to ask if you will help
me a little. Will you try?"</p>

<p>Elizabeth, surprised and pleased, vowed she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
would do all she could for Miss Margaret, in
any way in her power.</p>

<p>"You can do a great deal!" said Margaret.
"I&mdash;I am very young, Elizabeth, and&mdash;and
you and Frances have been here a long time,
and of course you know all about the work of
the house, and I know nothing at all. And
yet&mdash;and yet, I ought to be helping, it seems
to me, and ought to be taking my place, and
my share in the work. Do you see what I
mean, Elizabeth? You and Frances could help
me, oh, so much, if you would; and perhaps
some day I might be able to help you too,&mdash;I
don't know just how, yet, but it might come."</p>

<p>"Oh, miss, we will be so thankful!" cried
Elizabeth. "Oh, miss, Frances and me, we'd
been wishing and longing to have you speak
up and take your place, if I may say so. We
didn't like to put ourselves forward, and we've
no orders from Mr. Montfort, except to do
whatever you said; and so, when you'll say
anything, Miss Margaret, we feel ever and
ever so much better, Frances and me. And
I'll be pleased to go all over the work with
you, Miss Margaret, this very day, and show<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
you just how I've always done it, and I think
Mr. Montfort has been satisfied, and Mis'
Cheriton was, Lord rest her! and you so
young, and with so much else to do, as I said
time and again to Frances, reading with Mr.
Montfort and riding with him, and taking
such an interest in the roses, as his own
daughter couldn't make him happier if he
had one. And of course it's nature that you
haven't had no time yet to take much notice,
but it makes it twice as easy for servants,
Miss Margaret, where an interest is took; and
I'm thankful to you, I'm sure, and so will
Frances be, and you'll find her closets a
pleasure to look at."</p>

<p>Elizabeth stopped to draw breath, and
Margaret looked at her in wonder and self-reproach.
The grave, staid woman was all
alight with pleasure and the prospect of sympathy.
It came over Margaret that, comfortable
and homelike as their life at Fernley was,
it was not perhaps exactly thrilling.</p>

<p>"We will be friends, Elizabeth!" she said,
simply; and the two shook hands, with an
earnestness that meant something. "And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
you are to come to me, please, whenever there
is anything that needs attention, Elizabeth,
and I will do my best, and ask your advice
about anything I don't understand. Don't&mdash;don't
we&mdash;need some new napkins, Elizabeth?"</p>

<p>Elizabeth was eloquent as to their need of
napkins. In a couple of washes more, there
would be nothing but holes left to wipe their
hands on.</p>

<p>"Then I'll order some this very day," said
Margaret. "Or better still, I'll go to town
with Uncle John to-morrow, and get them myself.
And now, Elizabeth, I am going down
to see Frances, and&mdash;and perhaps&mdash;do you
think she would like it if I ordered dinner,
Elizabeth?"</p>

<p>"Miss Margaret, she'd be pleased to death!"
cried Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Returning from the kitchen an hour later, a
sadder and a wiser girl (for Frances's perfection
seemed unattainable by ordinary mortals,
even with the aid of Sapolio), Margaret heard
the sound of wheels on the gravel outside.
Glancing through the window of the long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
passage through which she was going, she
saw, to her amazement, a carriage standing at
the door, a carriage that had evidently come
some way, for it was covered with dust. The
driver was taking down a couple of trunks,
and beside the carriage stood a lady, with her
purse in her hand.</p>

<p>"I shall give you two dollars!" the lady
was saying, in a thin, sharp voice. "I consider
that ample for the distance you have
come."</p>

<p>"I told the gentleman it would be three
dollars, mum!" said the man, civilly, touching
his hat. "Three dollars is the regular
price, with one trunk, and these trunks is
mortal heavy. The gentleman said as it
would be all right, mum."</p>

<p>"The gentleman knew nothing whatever
about it," said the sharp-voiced lady. "I
shall give you two dollars, and not a penny
more. I have always paid two dollars to
drive to Fernley, and I have no idea of being
cheated now, I assure you."</p>

<p>The man was still grumbling, when Elizabeth
opened the door. She looked grave,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
but greeted the newcomer with a respectful
curtsey.</p>

<p>"Oh, how do you do, Elizabeth!" said the
strange lady. "How is Mr. Montfort?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Montfort is very well, thank you,
mum!" said Elizabeth. "He is in town,
mum. He'll hardly be back before evening.
Would you like to see Miss Montfort?"</p>

<p>"Miss Montfort? Oh, the little girl who is
staying here. You needn't trouble to call her
just now, Elizabeth. Send for Willis, will
you, and have him take my trunks in; I have
come to stay. He may put them in the
White Rooms."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I beg pardon, mum!" faltered Elizabeth.
"In the Blue Room, did you say?
The Blue Room has been new done over,
and that is where we have put visitors
lately."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort!" said the lady,
sharply. "I said the White Rooms; Mrs.
Cheriton's rooms."</p>

<p>Margaret stayed to hear no more. A
stranger in the White Rooms! Aunt Faith's
rooms, which she could not bear to occupy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
herself, though her uncle had urged her to do
so? And such a stranger as this, with such
a voice,&mdash;and such a nose! Never! never,
while there was breath to pant with, while
there were feet to run with!</p>

<p>Never but once in her life had Margaret
Montfort run as she did now; that once was
when she flew up the secret staircase to save
her cousin from burning. In a flash she was
in her own room&mdash;what had been her room!&mdash;gathering
things frantically in her arms,
snatching books from the table, dresses from
the closets. Down the back stairs she ran
like a whirlwind; down, and up, and down
again. Had the girl gone suddenly mad?</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, when Elizabeth, her eyes
smarting with angry tears, opened the door
of the White Parlour,&mdash;Willis the choreman
behind her, grunting and growling, with a
trunk on his shoulder,&mdash;a young lady was sitting
in the great white armchair, quietly reading.
The young lady's cheeks were crimson, her
eyes were sparkling, and her breath came in
short, quick gasps, which showed that what she
was reading must be very exciting; what made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
it the more curious was that the book was
upside down. But she was entirely composed,
and evidently surprised at the sudden
intrusion.</p>

<p>"What is it, Elizabeth?" asked Margaret,
quietly.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I beg your pardon, Miss Montfort!"
said Elizabeth, whose eyes were beginning
to brighten, too, and her lips to twitch
dangerously. "I&mdash;I didn't know, miss, as
you had&mdash;moved in yet. Here is Miss
Sophronia Montfort, miss, as perhaps you
would like to see her."</p>

<p>The strange lady was already glaring over
Willis's shoulder.</p>

<p>"What is this?" she said. "What does
this mean? These rooms are not occupied; I
was positively told they were not occupied.
There must be some mistake. Willis&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, there is a mistake!" said Margaret,
coming forward, and holding out her hand
with a smile. "Is this Cousin Sophronia? I
am Margaret, Cousin Sophronia. Uncle John
asked me to take these rooms, and I&mdash;I feel
quite at home in them already. Would you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
like the Pink, or the Blue Room? They are
both ready, aren't they, Elizabeth?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Montfort," said Elizabeth,
"quite ready."</p>

<p>The strange lady's eyes glared wider and
wider; her chest heaved; she seemed about to
break out in a torrent of angry speech; but
making a visible effort, she controlled herself.
"How do you do, my&mdash;my dear?" she
said, taking Margaret's offered hand, and
giving it a little pinch with the tips of her
fingers. "I&mdash;a little misunderstanding, no
doubt. Willis,&mdash;the Blue Room,&mdash;for the
present!" But Willis was suffering from a
sudden and violent fit of coughing, which
shook his whole frame, and made it necessary
for him to rest his trunk against the wall and
lean against it, with his head down; so that
it was fully five minutes before Miss Sophronia
Montfort's trunk got up to the Blue Room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>THE UNEXPECTED.</h3>


<p>When Mr. Montfort came home that afternoon,
Margaret was waiting for him, as usual,
on the verandah; as usual, for she was determined
to keep the worry out of her face and
out of her voice. But as her uncle came up
the steps, with his cheery "Well! and how's
my lassie?" he was confronted by Miss
Sophronia Montfort, who, passing Margaret
swiftly, advanced with both hands held out,
and a beaming smile.</p>

<p>"My dearest John! my poor, dear fellow!
Confess that I have surprised you. Confess
it, John!&mdash;you did not expect to see me."</p>

<p>"Sophronia!" exclaimed Mr. Montfort. He
stood still and contemplated the visitor for a
moment; then he shook hands with her,
rather formally.</p>

<p>"You certainly have surprised me, Sophro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>nia!"
he said, kindly enough. "What wind
has blown you in this direction?"</p>

<p>"The wind of affection, my dear boy!"
cried the strange lady. "I have been planning
it, ever since I heard of Aunt Faith's death.
Dearest Aunt Faith! What a loss, John! what
an irreparable loss! I shall never recover from
the shock. The moment I heard of it, I said&mdash;William
would tell you, if he were here&mdash;I
said, 'I must go to John! He will need me
now,' I said, 'and go I must.' I explained to
William that I felt it as a solemn duty. He
took it beautifully, poor, dear fellow. I don't
know how they will get on without me, for
his wife is sadly heedless, John, and the children
need a steady hand, they do indeed. But
he did not try to keep me back; indeed, he
urged me to come, which showed such a
beautiful spirit, didn't it? And so here I am,
my dearest boy, come to take Aunt Faith's
place, and make a home for you, my poor
lonely cousin. You know I have always
loved you as a sister, John, and you must consider
me a real sister now; sister Sophronia,
dear John!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The lady paused for breath, and gazed
tenderly on Mr. Montfort; that gentleman
returned her gaze with one of steady gravity.</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to have a visit from you,
Sophronia," he said. "I have no doubt we
can make you comfortable for a few weeks;
I can hardly suppose that William can spare
you longer than that. We have no children
here to need your&mdash;your ministrations."</p>

<p>The lady shook her head playfully; she had
thin curls of a grayish yellow, which almost
rattled when she shook her head.</p>

<p>"Always self-denying, John!" she cried.
"The same unselfish, good, sterling fellow!
But I understand, my friend; I know how it
really is, and I shall do my duty, and stand
by you; depend upon that! And this dear
child, too!" she added, turning to Margaret
and taking her hand affectionately. "So
young, so unexperienced! and to be attempting
the care of a house like Fernley! How
could you think of it, John? But we will
make that all right. I shall be&mdash;we can
hardly say a mother, can we, my dear? but
an elder sister, to you, too. Oh, we shall be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
very happy, I am sure. The drawing-room
carpets are looking very shabby, John. I am
ready to go over the dear old house from top
to bottom, and make it over new; of course
you did not feel like making any changes
while dear Aunt Faith was with you. Such a
mistake, I always say, to shake the aged out
of their ruts. Yes! so wise of you! and who
is in the neighbourhood, John?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know," said Mr. Montfort. "You
know I live rather a hermit life, Sophronia.
Mrs. Peyton is here; I believe you are fond of
her."</p>

<p>"Sweet Emily Peyton!" exclaimed Miss
Sophronia, with enthusiasm. "Is that exquisite
creature here? That will indeed be a
pleasure. Ah, John, she should never have
been Emily Peyton; you know my opinion on
that point." She nodded her head several
times, with an air of mysterious understanding.
"And widowed, after all, and once
more alone in the world. How does she bear
her sorrow, John?"</p>

<p>"I have not seen her," said Mr. Montfort,
rather shortly. "From what I hear, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
seems to bear it with considerable fortitude.
Perhaps you forget that it is fully ten years
since Mr. Peyton died, Sophronia. But Margaret
here can tell you more than I can about
Mrs. Peyton; she goes to see her now and
then. Mrs. Peyton is something of an invalid,
and likes to have her come."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" cried Miss Sophronia. "I should
hardly have fancied&mdash;Emily Peyton was always
so mature in her thought, so critical in
her observations; but no doubt she is lonely,
and glad of any society; and sweet Margaret
is most sympathetic, I am sure. Sympathy,
my dear John! how could we live without
it, my poor dear fellow?"</p>

<p>"I am going to walk," said Mr. Montfort,
abruptly. "Margaret, will you come? Sophronia,
you will be glad of a chance to rest;
you must be tired after your long drive."</p>

<p>"This once, yes, dearest John!" said the
lady. "This once you must go without me.
I am tired,&mdash;so thoughtful of you to notice
it! There is no sofa in the Blue Room, but I
shall do very well there for a few days.
Don't have me on your mind in the least,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
my dear cousin; I shall soon be absolutely at
home. Enjoy your walk, both of you! After
to-day, I shall always be with you, I hope. I
ordered tea an hour earlier, as I dined early,
and I knew you would not mind. Good-bye!"
and the lady nodded, and smiled herself into
the house.</p>

<p>Margaret went for her hat in silence, and
in silence she and her uncle walked along.
Mr. Montfort was smoking, not in his usual
calm and dignified manner, but in short,
fierce puffs; smoking fast and violently. Margaret
did not dare to speak, and they walked
a mile or more without exchanging a word.</p>

<p>"Margaret," said her uncle, at last.</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle John."</p>

<p>"Not in the least, my dear!"</p>

<p>"No, Uncle John."</p>

<p>They walked another mile, and presently
stopped at the top of a breezy hill, to draw
breath, and look about them. The sun was
going down in a cheerful blaze; the whole
country smiled, and was glad of its own
beauty. Mr. Montfort gazed about him, and
heaved a long sigh of content.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pretty! Pretty country!" he said.
"Spreading fields, quiet woods, sky over
all, undisturbed. Yes! You are very silent,
my dear. Have I been silent, too, or have
I been talking?"</p>

<p>"What a curious question!" thought Margaret.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you have not said much, Uncle
John," she replied.</p>

<p>"Well, my love, that may be because there
isn't much to say. Some situations, Margaret,
are best met in silence."</p>

<p>Margaret nodded. She knew her uncle's
ways pretty well by this time.</p>

<p>"And yet," continued Mr. Montfort, "it
may be well to have just a word of understanding
with you, my dear child. Sophronia
Montfort is my own cousin, my first cousin."</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle John," said Margaret, as he
seemed to pause for a reply.</p>

<p>"Ri tumpty,&mdash;that is to say, there is no
gainsaying that fact,&mdash;my own cousin. And
by natural consequence, Margaret, the own
cousin of your father, and by further consequence,
your first cousin once removed. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
is&mdash;a&mdash;it is many years since she has been
at Fernley; we must try to make her comfortable
during the time&mdash;the short time&mdash;she
is with us. You have put her in the Blue
Room; that is comfortable, is it, and properly
fitted up,&mdash;all the modern inconveniences
and abominations, eh?"</p>

<p>Mr. Montfort's own room had a bare floor,
a bed, a table, a chest of drawers, and a
pitcher and basin and bath that might have
been made for Cormoran or Blunderbore,
whichever was the bigger.</p>

<p>"Everything, I think, uncle," faltered Margaret,
turning crimson, and beginning to
tremble. "Oh! Oh, Uncle John! I have
something to tell you. I&mdash;I don't know
how to tell you."</p>

<p>"Don't try, then, my dear," said Uncle
John, in his own kind way. "Perhaps it
isn't necessary."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it is necessary. I shall have no
peace till I do, uncle,&mdash;you remember you
asked me to take the White Rooms; you
surely asked me, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Surely, my child," said Mr. Montfort,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
wondering much. "But I wished you to do
as you pleased, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes! Oh, uncle, that was it! When
Cousin Sophronia came, she&mdash;she told Elizabeth
to have her trunks carried into the
White Rooms."</p>

<p>"So!" said Mr. Montfort.</p>

<p>"Yes, uncle! I was in the passage, and
heard her give the order, and I&mdash;I could
not bear it, Uncle John, I could not, indeed.
I flew up-stairs, and brought down some of
my things,&mdash;all I could carry in two trips,&mdash;and,
when they came in with the trunk,
I&mdash;I was sitting there, and&mdash;and wondering
why they came into my room. Uncle John,
do you see? Was it very, very wicked?"</p>

<p>For all reply, Mr. Montfort went off into a
fit of laughter so prolonged and violent, that
Margaret, who at first tried to join in timidly,
became alarmed for him. "Ho! ho! ho!"
he laughed, throwing his head back, and
expanding his broad chest. "Ha! ha! ha!
so you&mdash;ho! ho!&mdash;you got in first, little
miss! Why wasn't I there to see? Oh, why
wasn't I there? I would give a farm, a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
farm, to have seen Sophronia's face. Tell me
about it again, Margaret. Tell me slowly, so
that I may see it all. You have a knack of
description, I know; show me the scene."</p>

<p>Slowly, half frightened, and wholly relieved,
Margaret went through the matter from beginning
to end, making as light as she could
of her own triumph, of which she really felt
ashamed, pleased as she was to have achieved
it. When she had finished, her uncle sat
down under a tree, and laughed again; not
so violently, but with a hearty enjoyment
that took in every detail.</p>

<p>"And Willis had a fit of coughing!" he
exclaimed, when Margaret had come to the
last word. "Poor Willis! Willis must see a
doctor at once. Consumptive, no doubt; and
concealed under such a deceptive appearance
of brawn! Ho! Margaret, my dear, I feel
better, much better. You have cleared the
air for me, my child."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;are not angry, then, Uncle John?
You don't think I ought to have put Cousin
Sophronia in the rooms?"</p>

<p>"My love, they should have been burned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
to the ground sooner. There was only one
person in the world whom your Aunt Faith
could not endure, and that person was Sophronia
Montfort. You did perfectly right,
Margaret; more right than you knew. If she
had got into the White Rooms, I should have
been under the necessity of taking her forcibly
out of them (nothing short of force could have
done it), and that would have created an
unpleasantness, you see. Yes! Thank you, my
dear little girl! I feel quite myself again.
We shall worry through, somehow; but remember,
Margaret, that you are the mistress
of Fernley, and, if you have any trouble,
come to me. And now, my love, we must
go home to tea!"</p>

<p>When the gong rang for tea, Margaret and
her uncle entered the dining-room together&mdash;to
find Cousin Sophronia already seated at
the head of the table, rattling the teacups
with intention.</p>

<p>"Well, my dears!" she cried, in sprightly
tones. "You walked further than you intended,
did you not? I should not have
sat down without you, but I was simply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
famished. I always think punctuality such
an important factor in the economy of life.
It is high time you had some steady head to
look after you, John!" and she shook her
head in affectionate playfulness. "Sit down,
John!"</p>

<p>Mr. Montfort did not sit down.</p>

<p>"I am sorry you were hungry, Sophronia,"
he said, kindly. "I cannot think of letting
you wait to pour tea for me, my dear cousin.
Margaret does that always; you are to sit
here by me, and begin at once upon your
own supper. Allow me!"</p>

<p>Margaret hardly knew how it was done.
There was a bow, a courtly wave of the
hand, a movement of chairs; and her own
place was vacant, and Cousin Sophronia was
sitting at the side place, very red in the face,
her eyes snapping out little green lights; and
Uncle John was bending over her with cordial
kindness, pushing her chair in a little
further, and lifting the train of her dress
out of the way. With downcast eyes, Margaret
took her place, and poured the tea in
silence. She felt as if a weight were on her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
eyelids; she could not lift her eyes; she
could not speak, and yet she must. She
shook herself, and made a great effort.</p>

<p>"How do you like your tea, Cousin Sophronia?"
she asked, in a voice that tried
to sound cheerful and unconcerned. And,
when she had spoken, she managed, with
another effort, to look up. Cousin Sophronia
was smiling and composed, and met her timid
glance with an affectionate nod.</p>

<p>"Weak, my dear, if you please,&mdash;weak,
with cream and sugar. Yes,&mdash;that will be excellent,
I have no doubt. I have to be a little
exact about my tea, my nerves being what
they are. The nights I have, if my tea is not
precisely the right shade! It seems absurd,
but life is made up of little things, my dear
John. And very right and wise, to have the
dear child learn to do these things, and practise
on us, even if it is a little trying at
first. Is that the beef tea, Elizabeth? Thank
you. I told Frances to make me some beef
tea, John; I knew hers could be depended
on, though I suppose she has grown rusty in
a good many ways, with this hermit life of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
yours,&mdash;so bad for a cook, I always think.
Yes, this is fair, but not quite what I should
have expected from Frances. I must see her
in the morning, and give her a good rousing;
we all need a good rousing once in awhile.
Frances and I have always been the best of
friends; we shall get on perfectly, I have no
doubt. Ah! The old silver looks well, John.
Where did that sugar-bowl come from? Is it
Montfort, or Paston? Paston, I fancy! The
Montfort silver is heavier, eh?"</p>

<p>"Possibly!" said Mr. Montfort. "That
sugar-bowl is neither one nor the other, however.
It is Dutch."</p>

<p>"Really! Vanderdecken? I didn't know
you had any Vanderdecken silver, John.
Grandmother Vanderdecken left all her silver,
I thought, to our branch. Such a mistake,
I always think, to scatter family silver.
Let each branch have <i>all</i> that belongs to it, I
always say. I feel very strongly about it."</p>

<p>"This is not Vanderdecken," said Mr.
Montfort, patiently. "I bought it in Amsterdam."</p>

<p>"Oh! in Amsterdam! indeed! boughten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
silver never appeals to me. And speaking of
silver, I have wished for years that I could
find a trace of the old Vanderdecken porringer.
You remember it, surely, John, at
Grandmother Vanderdecken's? She had her
plum porridge in it every night, and I used to
play with the cow on the cover. I have
tried and tried to trace it, but have never
succeeded. Stolen, I fear, by some dishonest
servant."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Cousin Sophronia,"
said Margaret, blushing. "I have the old
Vanderdecken porringer, if it is the one with
the cow on the cover."</p>

<p>"<i>You!</i>" cried Miss Sophronia, opening her
eyes to their fullest extent.</p>

<p>"Yes," Margaret replied. "There it is, on
the sideboard. I have eaten bread and milk
out of it ever since I can remember, and I
still use it at breakfast."</p>

<p>Speechless for the moment, Miss Sophronia
made an imperious sign to Elizabeth, who
brought her the beautiful old dish, not without
a glance of conscious pride at the wonderful
blue polish on it. There was no piece of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
plate in the house that took so perfect a
polish as this.</p>

<p>Miss Sophronia turned it over and over.
Her eyes were very green. "Margaret
Bleecker. On the occasion of her christening,
from her godmother," she read. "Yes,
this is certainly the Vanderdecken porringer.
And may I ask how you came by it, my
dear?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Cousin Sophronia. Aunt Eliza
Vanderdecken gave it to me at my christening;
she was my godmother, you see."</p>

<p>"A most extraordinary thing for Eliza
Vanderdecken to do!" cried the lady. "Eliza
Vanderdecken knew, of course, that she was
meant to have but a life-interest in the personal
property, as she never married. I cannot
understand Eliza's doing such a thing. I
have longed all my life for this porringer;
I have associations with it, you see, lifelong
associations. I remember my Grandmother
Vanderdecken distinctly; you never saw her,
of course, as she died years before you were
born."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Margaret, gently, but not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
without intention. "And I, Cousin Sophronia,
associate it with Aunt Eliza, whom I
remember distinctly, and who was my godmother,
and very kind to me. I value this
porringer more than almost any of my possessions.
Thank you, Elizabeth; if you would
put it back, please. Will you have some more
tea, Cousin Sophronia?"</p>

<p>"Let me give you another bit of chicken,
Sophronia!" said Mr. Montfort, heartily.
"I think we have had enough about porringers,
haven't we? There are six or seven, I
believe, in the strong closet. One of 'em was
Adam's, I've always been told. A little gravy,
Sophronia? You're eating nothing."</p>

<p>"I have no appetite!" said Miss Sophronia.
"You know I only eat to support life, John.
A side-bone, then, if you insist, and a tiny bit
of the breast. William always says, 'You
must live,' and I suppose I must. Cranberry
sauce! Thank you! I am really too exhausted
to enjoy a morsel, but I will make an effort.
We <i>can</i> do what we <i>try</i> to do, I always say.
Thank you, dearest John. I dare say I shall
be better to-morrow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>THE TRIALS OF MARGARET.</h3>


<p>Margaret woke early the next morning,
and lay wondering where she was. Her eyes
were used to opening on rose-flowered walls
and mahogany bed-posts. Here all was soft
and white, no spot of colour anywhere. She
came to herself with a start, and yesterday
with its happenings came back to her. She
sighed, and a little worried wrinkle came on
her smooth forehead. What a change, in a few
short hours! Was all their peaceful, dreamy
life over, the life that suited both her and her
uncle so absolutely? They had been so happy!
Was it over indeed? It seemed at first as if
she could not get up and face the cares of the
day, under the new conditions. Indolent by
nature, Margaret dreaded change, and above
change unpleasantness; it seemed as if she
might have plenty of both. She rose and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
dressed in a despondent mood; but when her
hair was pinned up and her collar straight,
she took herself to task. "I give you three
minutes!" she said, looking at herself in the
glass. "If you can't look cheerful by that
time, you can go to bed again."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 270px;">
<img src="images/gs02.png" width="270" height="400" alt="&quot;AFTERWARDS SHE SALLIED OUT INTO THE GARDEN.&quot;" title="&quot;AFTERWARDS SHE SALLIED OUT INTO THE GARDEN.&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;AFTERWARDS SHE SALLIED OUT INTO THE GARDEN.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The threat, or something else, carried the
point, for it was an entirely cheerful young
woman who came into the library, with a rose
for Uncle John's buttonhole. Miss Montfort
was already there, and responded with sad
sprightliness to Margaret's greeting. "Thank
you, my dear! I was just telling your uncle,
it is a mere matter of form to ask if I have
slept. I seldom sleep, especially if I am
up-stairs. The servants over my head, it may
be,&mdash;or if not that, I have the feeling of insecurity,&mdash;stairs,
you understand, in case of
fire. Dear William had my rooms fitted up
on the ground floor. 'Sophronia,' he said,
'you must sleep!' I suppose it is necessary,
but I am so used to lying awake. Such
frightful noises in the walls, my dear John!
Rats, I suppose? Has the wainscoting been
examined lately, in the room you have put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
me in? Not that it matters in the least; I
am the person in the world most easily suited,
I suppose. A cot, a corner, a crust, as William
says, and I am satisfied."</p>

<p>It took several crusts to satisfy Miss
Sophronia at breakfast. Afterwards she sallied
out into the garden, where Mr. Montfort
was enjoying his morning cigar, with Margaret
at his side. "You dear child," said the
sprightly lady, "run now and amuse yourself,
or attend to any little duties you may have
set yourself. So important, I always say, for
the young to be regular in everything they
do. I am sure you agree with me, dearest
John. I will be your uncle's companion, my
love; that is my duty and my pleasure now.
I must see your roses, John! No one in the
world loves roses as I do. What do you use
for them? I have a recipe for an infallible
wash; I must give it to you, I must indeed."</p>

<p>Margaret went into the house; there was
no place for her, for the lady was leaning on
Mr. Montfort's arm, chattering gaily in his
ear. Margaret was conscious of an unpleasant
sensation which was entirely new to her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
She had always been with people she liked.
Rita had often distressed her, but still she
was most lovable, with all her faults. Cousin
Sophronia was&mdash;not&mdash;lovable, the girl said
to herself.</p>

<p>It was a relief to visit the kitchen, and
find Frances beaming over her bread-pan.
The good woman hailed Margaret with delight,
and received her timid suggestions as
to dinner with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Margaret, I do think as a chicken-pie
would be the very thing. I've a couple
of fowl in the house now, and what would
you think of putting in a bit of ham, miss?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Margaret. "Is that what you
usually do, Frances? Then I am sure it will
be just right. And about a pudding; what
do you think, Frances? You know so many
kinds of puddings, and they are all so good!"</p>

<p>Well, Frances had been thinking that if Miss
Margaret should fancy apple-fritters, Mr. Montfort
was fond of them, and they had not had
them this month. And lemon-juice with them,
or a little sugar and wine; which did Miss
Margaret think would be best? This was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
delightful way of keeping house; and after
praising the bread, which was rising white
and light in the great pan, and poking the
bubbles with her little finger, and begging
that she might be allowed to mix it some day
soon, Margaret went back in a better humour
to the White Rooms, and sat down resolutely
to her buttonholes. There would be no walk
this morning, evidently; well, when she had
done her hour's stint, she would go for a little
stroll by herself. After all, perhaps Uncle
John would, when the strangeness had worn
off a little, enjoy having some one of his
own age to talk to; of course she was very
young, too young to be much of a companion.
Still,&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, she would be cheerful and patient,
and try to make things pleasant so far as she
could. And now she could only go and wish
Uncle John good-bye when he started for
town, and perhaps walk to the station with
him, if he was going to walk.</p>

<p>While she sat sewing, glancing at the clock
from time to time, Cousin Sophronia came in,
work-bag in hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is gone!" she said, cheerfully. "I
saw him off at the gate. Dearest John! Excellent,
sterling John Montfort! Such a
pleasure to be with him! Such a joy to feel
that I can make a home for him!"</p>

<p>"Gone!" echoed Margaret, looking up in
dismay. "Why, surely it is not train time!"</p>

<p>"An early train, my love," the lady explained.
"Your dear uncle felt obliged to
start an hour earlier than usual, he explained
to me. These busy men! And how are you
occupying yourself, my dear? Ah! buttonholes?
Most necessary! But, my love, you
are working these the wrong way!"</p>

<p>"No, I think not," said Margaret. "This
is the way I have always made them, Cousin
Sophronia."</p>

<p>"Wrong, my dear! Quite wrong, I assure
you. Impossible to get a smooth edge if you
work them that way. Let me&mdash;h'm! yes!
that is fairly even, I confess; but the other
way is the correct one, you must take my
word for it; and I will show you how, with
pleasure. So important, I always say, to do
things just as they should be done!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>In vain Margaret protested that she understood
the other way, but preferred this. She
finally, for quiet's sake, yielded, and pricked
her fingers, and made herself hot and cross,
working the wrong way.</p>

<p>Miss Sophronia next began to cross-question
her about Mrs. Cheriton's last days. Such a
saintly woman! Austere, some thought; perhaps
not always charitable&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Margaret, indignant. "Cousin
Sophronia, you cannot have known Aunt Faith
at all. She was the very soul of charity; and
as for being austere&mdash;but it is evident you
did not know her." She tried to keep down
her rising temper, with thoughts of the sweet,
serene eyes that had never met hers without a
look of love.</p>

<p>"I knew her before you were born, my
dear!" said Miss Sophronia, with a slightly
acid smile. "Oh, yes, I was intimately acquainted
with dear Aunt Faith. I have never
thought it right to be blind to people's little
failings, no matter how much we love them.
I always tell my brother William, 'William,
do not ask me to be blind! Ask me, expect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
me, to be indulgent, to be devoted, to be self-sacrificing,&mdash;but
not blind; blindness is contrary
to my nature, and you must not expect
it.' Yes! And&mdash;what was done with the
clothes, my dear?"</p>

<p>"The clothes?" echoed Margaret. "Aunt
Faith's clothes, do you mean, Cousin Sophronia?"</p>

<p>"No. I meant the Montfort clothes; the
heirlooms, my dear. But perhaps you never
saw them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I have seen them often," said
Margaret. "They are in the cedar chest,
Cousin Sophronia, where they have always
been. It is in the deep closet there," she
nodded towards an alcove at the other end of
the room.</p>

<p>Miss Sophronia rose with alacrity. "Ah!
I think I will look them over. Very valuable,
some of those clothes are; quite unsuitable,
I have thought for some years, to have
them under the charge of an aged person,
who could not in the course of nature be
expected to see to them properly. I fear I
shall find them in a sad condition."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Her hand was already on the door, when
Margaret was able to speak. "Excuse me,
Cousin Sophronia; the chest is locked."</p>

<p>"Very proper! Entirely proper!" cried the
lady. "And you have the key? That will not
do, will it, my love? Too heavy for these dear
young shoulders, such a weight of responsibility!
I will take entire charge of this; not a
word! It will be a pleasure! Where is the
key, did you say, love?"</p>

<p>"Uncle John has the key!" said Margaret,
quietly; and blamed herself severely for the
pleasure she felt in saying it.</p>

<p>"Oh!" Miss Montfort paused, her hand on
the door; for a moment she seemed at a loss;
but she went on again.</p>

<p>"Right, Margaret! Very right, my love!
You felt yourself, or your uncle felt for you,
the unfitness of your having charge of such
valuables. Ahem! I&mdash;no doubt dear John
will give me the key, as soon as I mention it.
I&mdash;I shall not speak of it at once; there is
no hurry&mdash;except for the danger of moth.
An old house like Fernley is always riddled
with moth. I fear the clothes must be quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
eaten away with them. Such a sad pity! The
accumulation of generations!"</p>

<p>Margaret hastened to assure her that the
clothes were looked over regularly once a
month, and that no sign of moths had ever
been found in them. Miss Sophronia sighed
and shook her head, and crocheted for some
minutes in silence; she was making a brown
and yellow shoulder-shawl. Margaret thought
she had never seen a shawl so ugly.</p>

<p>"Has Cousin William Montfort any daughters?"
she asked, presently, thinking it her
turn to bear some of the burden of entertainment.</p>

<p>"Four, my dear!" was the prompt reply.
"Sweet girls! young, heedless, perhaps not
always considerate; but the sweetest girls
in the world. Amelia is just your age;
what a companion she would be for you!
Dear Margaret! I must write to William, I
positively must, and suggest his asking you
for a good long visit. Such a pleasure for
you and for Amelia! Not a word, my dear! I
shall consider it a duty, a positive duty!
Amelia is thought to resemble me in many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
ways; she is the image of what I was at her
age. I am forming her; her mother is something
of an invalid, as I think I have told you.
The older girls are away from home just now,&mdash;they
make a good many visits; I am
always there, and they feel that they can go.
If they were at home, I should beg dear John
Montfort to invite Amelia here; such a pleasure
for him, to have young life in the house.
But as it is, William must ask you. Consider
it settled, my love. A&mdash;what was done with
Aunt Faith's jewels, my dear? She had some
fine pearls, I remember. Vanderdecken pearls
they were originally; I should hardly suppose
Aunt Faith would have felt that she had more
than a life interest in them. And the great
amethyst necklace; did she ever show you her
jewels, my love?"</p>

<p>Margaret blushed, and braced herself to
meet the shock. "I have them, Cousin
Sophronia!" she said, meekly. "Aunt Faith
wanted me to have all her jewels, and she
gave them to me before&mdash;before she died."
Her voice failed, and the tears rushed to her
eyes. She was thinking of the frail, white-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>clad
figure bending over the ancient jewel-box,
and taking out the pearls. She heard the soft
voice saying, "Your great-grandmother's pearls,
my Margaret; they are yours now. Wear
them for me, and let me have the pleasure of
seeing them on your neck. You are my
pearl, Margaret; the only pearl I care for
now." Dear, dearest Aunt Faith. Why was
she not here?</p>

<p>Before Miss Sophronia could recover her
power of speech, a knock came at the door.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Miss Margaret!" said
Elizabeth, putting her head in, in answer to
Margaret's "Come in!" "The butcher is
here, miss, and Frances thought perhaps,
would you come out and see him, miss?"</p>

<p>"Certainly!" said Margaret, rising; but
Miss Sophronia was too quick for her.</p>

<p>"In a moment!" she cried, cheerfully.
"Tell Frances I will be there in a moment,
Elizabeth! Altogether too much for you, dear
Margaret, to have so much care. <i>I</i> cannot
have too much care! It is what I live for;
give the household matters no further thought,
I beg of you. You might be setting your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
bureau drawers in order, if you like, while I
am seeing the butcher; I always look over
Amelia's drawers once a week&mdash;"</p>

<p>She glided away, leaving Margaret white
with anger. How was she to endure this?
She was nearly eighteen; she had taken care
of herself ever since she was seven, and had
attained, or so she fancied, perfection, in the
matter of bureau-drawers, at the age of twelve.
To have her precious arrangements looked
over, her boxes opened, her&mdash;oh, there could
be, there <i>was</i> no reason why she should submit
to this! She locked the drawers quietly, one
after the other, and put the key in her
pocket. She would be respectful; she would
be civil always, and cordial when she could,
but she would not be imposed upon.</p>

<p>By the time Miss Sophronia came back,
Margaret was composed, and greeted her
cousin with a pleasant smile; but this time it
was the lady who was agitated. She came
hurrying in, her face red, her air perturbed.
"Insufferable!" she cried, as soon as the door
was closed. "Margaret, that woman is insufferable!
She must leave at once."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Woman! what woman, Cousin Sophronia?"
asked Margaret, looking up in amazement.</p>

<p>"That Frances! She&mdash;why, she is impertinent,
Margaret. She insulted me; insulted
me grossly. I shall speak to John Montfort
directly he returns. She must go; I cannot
stay in the house with her."</p>

<p>Go! Frances, who had been at Fernley
twenty years; for whom the new kitchen, now
only fifteen years old, had been planned and
arranged! Margaret was struck dumb for a
moment; but recovering herself, she tried to
soothe the angry lady, assuring her that
Frances could not have meant to be disrespectful;
that she had a quick temper, but was so
good and faithful, and so attached to Uncle
John; and so on. In another moment, to her
great discomfiture, Miss Sophronia burst into
tears, declared that she was alone in the
world, that no one loved her or wanted her,
and that she was the most unhappy of women.
Filled with remorseful pity, Margaret bent
over her, begging her not to cry. She brought
a smelling-bottle, and Miss Sophronia clutched
it, sobbing, and told Margaret she was an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
angelic child. "This&mdash;this is&mdash;a Vanderdecken
vinaigrette!" she said, between her
sobs. "Did Eliza Vanderdecken give you
this, too? Very singular of Eliza! But she
never had any sense of fitness. Thank you
my dear! I suffer&mdash;no living creature knows
what I suffer with my nerves. I&mdash;shall be
better soon. Don't mind anything I said; I
must suffer, but it shall always be in silence,
I always maintain that. No one shall know;
I never speak of it; I am the grave, for
silence. Do not&mdash;do not tell your uncle,
Margaret, how you have seen me suffer. Do
not betray my momentary weakness!"</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" said Margaret, heartily.
"I will not say a word, Cousin Sophronia, of
course!"</p>

<p>"He would wish to know!" said Miss
Sophronia, smothering a sob into a sigh.
"John Montfort would be furious if he
thought I was ill-treated, and we were concealing
it from him. He is a lion when once
roused. Ah! I should be sorry for that
woman. But forgiveness is a duty, my dear,
and I forgive. See! I am myself again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Quite&mdash;" with a hysterical giggle&mdash;"quite
myself! I&mdash;I will take the vinaigrette to my
room with me, I think, my dear. Thank
you! Dear Margaret! cherub child! how you
have comforted me!" She went, and Margaret
heard her sniffing along the entry;
heard, and told herself she had no business to
notice such things; and went back rather
ruefully to her buttonholes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>A NEW TYPE.</h3>


<p>"My child, I thought you were never coming
again!" said Mrs. Peyton. "Do you
know that it is a week since I have seen you?
I have been destroyed,&mdash;positively destroyed,
with solitude."</p>

<p>"I am so sorry," said Margaret. "I could
not come before; truly I could not, Mrs. Peyton.
And how have you been?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Peyton leaned back on her pillows,
with a little laugh. "Who cares how I have
been?" she said, lightly. "What does it
matter how I have been? Tell me some
news, Margaret. I must have news. You
are alive, you move, and have your being;
tell me something that will make me feel
alive, too."</p>

<p>Margaret looked at the lady, and thought
she looked very much alive. She was a vision<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of rose colour, from the silk jacket fluttering
with ribbons, to the pink satin that shimmered
through the lace bed-spread. The rosy
colour almost tinted her cheeks, which were
generally the hue of warm ivory. Her hair,
like crisped threads of gold, was brought
down low on her forehead, hiding any lines
that might have been seen there; it was
crowned by a bit of cobweb lace, that seemed
too slight to support the pink ribbon that
held it together. The lady's hands were
small, and exquisitely formed, and she wore
several rings of great value; her eyes were
blue and limpid, her features delicate and
regular. Evidently, this had been a great
beauty. To Margaret, gazing at her in
honest admiration, she was still one of the
most beautiful creatures that could be seen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peyton laughed under the girl's simple
look of pleasure. "You like my new jacket?"
she said. "The doctor never so much as noticed
it this morning. I think I shall send
him away, and get another, who has eyes in
his head. You are the only person who
really cares for my clothes, Margaret, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
they are the only interest I have in the
world."</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't talk so!" said Margaret,
colouring. "You don't mean it, and
why will you say it?"</p>

<p>"I do mean it!" said the beautiful lady.
"I mean every word of it. There's nothing
else to care for, except you, you dear little
old-fashioned thing. I like you, because you
are quaint and truthful. Have you seen my
pink pearl? You are not half observant,
that's the trouble with you, Margaret Montfort."</p>

<p>She held out her slender hand; Margaret
took it, and bent over it affectionately.
"Oh, what a beautiful ring!" she cried.
"I never saw a pink pearl like this before,
Mrs. Peyton, so brilliant, and such a deep
rose colour. Isn't it very wonderful?"</p>

<p>"The jeweller thought so," said Mrs. Peyton.
"He asked enough for it; it might have
been the companion to Cleopatra's. The opal
setting is pretty, too, don't you think? And
I have some new stones. You will like to see
those."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>She took up a small bag of chamois leather,
that lay on the bed beside her, opened it, and
a handful of precious stones rolled out on the
lace spread. Margaret caught after one and
another in alarm. "Oh! Oh, Mrs. Peyton,
they frighten me! Why, this diamond&mdash;I
never saw such a diamond. It's as big as
a pea."</p>

<p>"Imperfect!" said the lady. "A flaw in it,
you see; but the colour is good, and it does
just as well for a plaything, though I don't
like flawed things, as a rule. This sapphire
is a good one,&mdash;deep, you see; I like a deep
sapphire."</p>

<p>"This light one is nearer your eyes,"
said Margaret, taking up a lovely clear blue
stone.</p>

<p>"Flatterer! People used to say that once;
a long time ago. Heigh ho, Margaret, don't
ever grow old! Take poison, or throw yourself
out of the window, but don't grow old.
It's a shocking thing to do."</p>

<p>Margaret looked at her friend with troubled,
affectionate eyes, and laid her hand on the
jewelled fingers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I mean it!" said the lady, with a
pretty little grimace. "I mean it, Miss Puritan.
See! Here's a pretty emerald. But you
haven't told me the news. Mr. Montfort is
well always?"</p>

<p>"Always!" said Margaret. "We&mdash;we
have a visitor just now, Mrs. Peyton,&mdash;some
one you know."</p>

<p>"Some one I know?" cried Mrs. Peyton.
"I thought every one I knew was dead and
buried. Who is it, child? Don't keep me in
suspense. Can't you see that I am palpitating?"</p>

<p>She laughed, and looked so pretty, and so
malicious, that Margaret wanted to kiss and
to shake her at the same moment.</p>

<p>"It is a cousin of Uncle John's and of
mine," she said; "Miss Sophronia Montfort."</p>

<p>"<i>What!</i>" cried Mrs. Peyton, sitting up in
bed. "Sophronia Montfort? You are joking,
Margaret."</p>

<p>Assured that Margaret was not joking, she
fell back again on her pillows. "Sophronia
Montfort!" she said, laughing softly. "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
have not heard of her since the flood. How
does John&mdash;how does Mr. Montfort endure
it, Pussy? He was not always a patient
man."</p>

<p>Margaret thought her uncle one of the most
patient men she had ever seen.</p>

<p>"And how many men have you seen, little
girl? Never mind! I will allow him all the
qualities of the Patient Patriarch. He will
need them all, if he is to have Sophronia
long. I am sorry for you, Pussy! Come
over as often as you can to see me. I am
dull, but there are worse things than dullness."</p>

<p>This was not very encouraging.</p>

<p>"She&mdash;Cousin Sophronia&mdash;sent you a
great many messages," Margaret said, timidly.
"She&mdash;is very anxious to see you,
Mrs. Peyton. She would like to come over
some morning, and spend an hour with you."</p>

<p>"If she does, I'll poison her!" said Mrs.
Peyton, promptly. "Don't look shocked, Margaret
Montfort; I shall certainly do as I say.
Sophronia comes here at peril of her life, and
you may tell her so with my compliments."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Margaret sat silent and distressed, not
knowing what to say. She had known
very few people in her quiet life, and this
beautiful lady, whom she admired greatly,
also puzzled her sadly.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell her that, can I, dear Mrs.
Peyton?" she said, at last. "I shall tell her
that you are not well,&mdash;that is true, most
certainly,&mdash;and that you do not feel able
to see her."</p>

<p>"Tell her what you please," said Emily
Peyton, laughing again. "If she comes, I
shall poison her,&mdash;that is my first and last
word. Tell her? Tell her that Emily Peyton
is a wreck; that she lies here like a log,
week after week, month after month, caring
for nothing, no one caring for her, except
a kind little girl, who is frightened at her
wild talk. I might try the poison on myself
first, Margaret; what do you think of that?"
Then, seeing Margaret's white, shocked face,
she laughed again, and fell to tossing the
gems into the air, and catching them as they
fell. "It would be a pity, though, just when
I have got all these new playthings. Did you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
bring a book to read to me, little girl? I
can't abide reading, but I like to hear your
voice. You have something, I see it in
your guilty face. Poetry, I'll be bound.
Out with it, witch! You hope to bring me
to a sense of the error of my ways. Why,
I used to read poetry, Margaret, by the dozen
yards. Byron,&mdash;does any one read Byron
nowadays?"</p>

<p>"My father was fond of Byron," said Margaret.
"He used to read me bits of 'Childe
Harold' and the 'Corsair;' I liked them,
and I always loved the 'Assyrian.' But&mdash;I
thought you might like something bright
and cheerful to-day, Mrs. Peyton, so I brought
Austin Dobson. Are you fond of Dobson?"</p>

<p>"Never heard of him!" said the lady, carelessly.
"Read whatever you like, child;
your voice always soothes me. Will you
come and be my companion, Margaret? Your
uncle has Sophronia now; he cannot need
you. Come to me! You shall have a thousand,
two thousand dollars a year, and all
the jewels you want. I'll have these set for
you, if you like."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 268px;">
<img src="images/gs03.png" width="268" height="400" alt="&quot;&#39;DID YOU BRING A BOOK TO READ TO ME, LITTLE GIRL?&#39;&quot;" title="&quot;&#39;DID YOU BRING A BOOK TO READ TO ME, LITTLE GIRL?&#39;&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;DID YOU BRING A BOOK TO READ TO ME, LITTLE GIRL?&#39;&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>She seemed only half in earnest, and Margaret
laughed. "You sent your last companion
away, you know, Mrs. Peyton," she
said. "I'm afraid I should not suit you,
either."</p>

<p>"My dear, that woman ate apples! No
one could endure that, you know. Ate&mdash;champed
apples in my ears, and threw the
cores into my grate. Positively, she smelt of
apples all day long. I had to have the room
fumigated when she left. A dreadful person!
One of her front teeth was movable, too, and
set me distracted every time she opened her
mouth. Are you ever going to begin?"</p>

<p>Margaret read two or three of her favourite
poems, but with little heart in her reading,
for she felt that her listener was not listening.
Now and then would come an impatient
sigh, or a fretful movement of the jewelled
hands; once a sapphire was tossed up in the
air, and fell on the floor by Margaret's feet.
Only when she began the lovely "Good Night,
Babette!" did Mrs. Peyton's attention seem
to fix. She listened quietly, and, at the end,
drew a deep breath.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"You call that bright and cheerful, do
you?" Mrs. Peyton murmured. "Everything
looks cheerful in the morning. Good
night,&mdash;"I grow so old,"&mdash;how dare you
read me such a thing as that, Margaret
Montfort? It is an impertinence."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Margaret, colouring, and
now really wounded. "I do not understand
you at all to-day, Mrs. Peyton. I don't seem
to be able to please you, and it is time for
me to go."</p>

<p>She rose, and the lady, her mood changing
again in an instant, took her two hands, and
drew her close to her side.</p>

<p>"You are my only comfort," she said.
"Do you hear that? You are the only
person in this whole dreadful place that I
would give the half of a burnt straw to
see. Remember that, when I behave too
abominably. Yes, go now, for I am going
to have a bad turn. Send Antonia; and
come again soon&mdash;soon, do you hear, Margaret?
But remember&mdash;remember that the
poison-bowl waits for Sophronia!"</p>

<p>"What&mdash;shall I give her any message?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
said poor Margaret, as she bent to kiss the
white forehead between the glittering waves
of hair.</p>

<p>"Give her my malediction," said Mrs. Peyton.
"Tell her it is almost a consolation for
lying here, to think I need not see her. Tell
her anything you like. Go now! Good-bye,
child! Dear little quaint, funny, prim child,
good-bye!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Margaret walked home sadly enough. She
loved and admired her beautiful friend, but
she did not understand her, and there was
much that she could not approve. It seemed
absurd, she often said to herself, for a girl of
her age to criticise, to venture to disapprove,
of a woman old enough to be her mother, one
who had travelled the world over, and knew
plenty of human nature, if little of books.
Yet, the thought would come again, there was
no age to right and wrong; and there were
things that it could not be right to think,
or kind to say, at eighteen or at eighty.
And her uncle did not like Mrs. Peyton.
Margaret felt that, without his having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
ever put it into words. Still, she was so
beautiful, so fascinating,&mdash;and so kind to
her! Perhaps, unconsciously, Margaret did
miss a good deal the two young cousins
who had been with her during her first
year at Fernley; surely, and every hour,
she missed her Aunt Faith, whose tenderness
had been that of the mother she had never
known.</p>

<p>She was in no haste to go home; there was
still an hour before Uncle John would come.
There was little peace at home in these days,
but a prying eye, and a tongue that was seldom
still save in sleep. She had left Elizabeth in
tears to-day, her precious linen having been
pulled over, and all the creases changed because
they ran the wrong way. In vain
Margaret had reminded her of the heroine of
the story she had liked so much, the angelic
Elizabeth of Hungary. "It don't make much
difference, Miss Margaret!" Elizabeth said.
"I am no saint, miss, and all the roses in the
world wouldn't make my table-cloths look fit
to go on, now."</p>

<p>Frances was "neither to hold or to bind;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
even the two young girls whom the elder
women had in training were tossing their
heads and muttering over their brasses and
their saucepans. The apple of discord seemed
to be rolling all about the once peaceful rooms
of Fernley House. "I'll go home through the
woods," said Margaret, "and see if they have
begun work on the bog yet."</p>

<p>It was lovely in the woods. Margaret
thought there could be no such woods in the
world as these of Fernley. The pines were
straight and tall, and there was little or no
undergrowth; just clear, fragrant stretches of
brown needles, where one could lie at length
and look up into the whispering green, and
watch the birds and squirrels. There was
moss here and there; here and there, too, a
bed of pale green ferns, delicate and plumy;
but most of it was the soft red-brown carpet
that Margaret loved better even than ferns.
She walked slowly along, drinking in beauty
and rest at every step. If she could only
bring the sick lady out here, she thought, to
breathe this life-giving air! Surely she would
be better! She did not look ill enough to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
stay always in bed. They must try to bring
it about.</p>

<p>She stopped at the little brook, and sat
down on a mossy stone. The water was clear
and brown, breaking into white over the
pebbles here and there. How delightful it
would be to take off her shoes and stockings,
and paddle about a little! Peggy, her cousin,
would have been in the water in an instant,
very likely shoes and all; but Margaret was
timid, and it required some resolution to pull
off her shoes and stockings, and a good deal
of glancing over her shoulder, to make sure
that no one was in sight. Indeed, who could
be? The water was cool; oh, so cool and
fresh! She waded a little way; almost lost her
balance on a slippery stone, and fled back to
the bank, laughing and out of breath. A frog
came up to look at her, and goggled in amazement;
she flipped water at him with her hand,
and he vanished indignant. It would be very
pleasant to walk along the bed of the stream,
as far as the entrance to the bog meadow.
Could she venture so far? No, for after all, it
was possible that some of the workmen might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
have arrived and might be in the neighbourhood,
though they were not to begin work till
the next day. Very slowly Margaret drew
her feet out of the clear stream where they
twinkled and looked so white,&mdash;Margaret had
pretty feet,&mdash;but she could not make up her
mind to put on the shoes and stockings just
yet. She must dry her feet; and this moss
was delightful to walk on. So on she went,
treading lightly and carefully, finding every
step a pure pleasure, till she saw sunlight
breaking through the green, and knew that
she was coming to the edge of the peat bog.
Ah, what memories this place brought to
Margaret's mind! She could see her cousin
Rita, springing out in merry defiance over the
treacherous green meadow; could hear her
scream, and see her sinking deep, deep, into
the dreadful blackness below. Then, like a
flash, came Peggy from the wood, this very
wood she was walking in now, and ran, and
crept, and reached out, and by sheer strength
and cleverness saved Rita from a dreadful
death, while she, Margaret, stood helpless by.
Dear, brave Peggy! Ah, dear girls both! How<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
she would like to see them this moment.
Why! Why, what was that?</p>

<p>Some one was whistling out there in the
open. Whistling a lively, rollicking air, with
a note as clear and strong as a bird's. Horror!
The workmen must have come! Margaret
was down on the grass in an instant,
pulling desperately at her shoes and stockings.
From the panic she was in, one might
have thought that the woods were full of
whistling brigands, all rushing in her direction,
with murder in their hearts. She could
hardly see; there was a knot in her shoe-string;
why did she ever have shoes that
tied? Her heart was beating, the blood
throbbing in her ears,&mdash;and all the time
the whistling went on, not coming nearer,
but trilling away in perfect cheerfulness,
though broken now and then, and coming
in fits and starts. At last! At last the
shoes were tied, and Margaret stood up,
still panting and crimson, but feeling that
she could face a robber, or even an innocent
workman, without being disgraced for life.
Cautiously she stole to the edge of the wood,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and peeped between the pine-boles. The sun
lay full on the peat bog, and it shone like a
great, sunny emerald, friendly and smiling,
with no hint of the black treachery at its
heart. No hint? But look! Out in the
very middle of the bog a figure was standing,
balanced on a tussock of firm earth.
A light, active figure, in blue jean jumper
and overalls. One of the workmen, who
did not know of the peril, and was plunging
to his destruction? Margaret opened her
lips to cry aloud, but kept silence, for the
next moment she comprehended that the
young man (he was evidently young, though
his back was turned to her) knew well enough
what he was about. He had a long pole in
his hand, and with this he was poking and
prodding about in the black depths beneath
him. Now he sounded carefully a little way
ahead of him, and then, placing his pole
carefully on another firm spot, leaped to it
lightly. The black bog water gurgled up
about his feet, but he did not sink, only
planted his feet more firmly, and went on
with his sounding. Now he was singing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
What was he singing? What a quaint,
funny air!</p>

<div class='poem'>
"A wealthy young farmer of Plymouth, we hear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He courted a nobleman's daughter, so dear;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And for to be married it was their intent,&mdash;</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Hi! muskrat!&mdash;come out of there!" He
almost lost his balance, and Margaret
screamed a very small scream, that could
not be heard a dozen yards. Recovering
himself, the young man began to make his
way towards the shore, at a point nearly
opposite to where Margaret stood. Springing
lightly to the firm ground, he took off
his cap, and made a low bow to the bog,
saying at the same time something, Margaret
could not hear what. Then, looking
carefully about him, the young workman
appeared to be selecting a spot of earth
that was to his mind; having done so, he
sat down, took out a note-book, and wrote
with ardour for several minutes. Then he
took off his cap, and ran his fingers through
his hair&mdash;which was very curly, and bright
red&mdash;till it stood up in every direction; then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
he turned three elaborate somersaults; and
then, with another salute to the bog, and a
prolonged whistle, he went off, leaping on his
pole, and singing, as he went:</div>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>A LESSON IN GEOGRAPHY.</h3>


<p>"Margaret!"</p>

<p>"Yes, uncle."</p>

<p>"Can you come here a moment, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Surely, Uncle John. I was looking for
you, and could not find you."</p>

<p>Margaret came running in from the garden.
Her uncle was sitting in his private study,
which opened directly on the garden, and
communicated by a staircase in the wall with
his bedroom. The study was a pleasant room,
lined with books for the most part, but with
some valuable pictures, and a great table full
of drawers, and several presses or secretaries,
filled with papers and family documents of
every kind. Mr. John Montfort, recluse
though he was, was the head of a large and
important family connection. Few of his
relatives ever saw him, but most of them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
were in more or less constant correspondence
with him, and he knew all their secrets,
though not one of them could boast of knowing
his. He was the friend and adviser, the
kindly helper, of many a distant cousin who
had never met the kind, grave glance of his
brown eyes. Peggy Montfort used to say,
in the days when it had pleased him to appear
as John Strong, the gardener, that it
"smoothed her all out," just to look at him;
and many people experienced the same feeling
on receiving one of his letters. No one
had it, however, so strongly as Margaret herself,
or so she thought; and it was with a
sensation of delightful relief that she answered
his call this morning. Mr. Montfort turned
round from the great table at which he was
sitting, and held out his hand affectionately.</p>

<p>"Come here, my child," he said, "and let
me look at you. Look me straight in the
eyes; yes, that will do. You are feeling well,
Margaret? You look well, I must say."</p>

<p>"Well? Of course, Uncle John! Am I
ever anything else? I have never had a
day's illness since I came here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"You do not feel the load of responsibility
too much for your young shoulders?" Mr.
Montfort went on. "It&mdash;it is not too dull
for you here, alone month after month with
an elderly man, and a hermit, and one
who has the reputation of a grim and unfriendly
old fellow? What do you say,
Margaret?"</p>

<p>The quick tears sprang to Margaret's eyes.
She looked up at her uncle, and saw in his
eyes the quizzical twinkle that always half
puzzled and wholly delighted her. "Oh,
uncle!" she cried; "you really deceived me
this time! I might have known you were in
fun,&mdash;but you were so grave!"</p>

<p>"Grave?" said Mr. Montfort. "Never
more so, I assure you. I may not have very
serious doubts, in my own mind; nevertheless,
I want your assurance. Do you, Margaret
Montfort, find life a burden under
existing circumstances, or do you find it&mdash;well,
endurable for awhile yet?"</p>

<p>"I find life as happy as I can imagine it,"
said Margaret, simply; and then, being absolutely
truthful, she added, "That is,&mdash;I did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
find it so, Uncle John,&mdash;until these last two
weeks."</p>

<p>"Precisely!" said Mr. Montfort. "Not a
word, my dear! I understand you. You are
fond of children, I think, Margaret?"</p>

<p>"Very fond," said Margaret, thinking that
Uncle John was strange indeed to-day.</p>

<p>"Get on well with them, I should suppose.
You had a great deal of influence over Peggy,
Margaret."</p>

<p>"Dear, good Peggy! She was so ready to be
influenced, Uncle John. She was just waiting
to&mdash;to be helped on a little, don't you
know?"</p>

<p>"Yes; so Rita thought, if I remember
aright!" said Mr. Montfort, dryly. "But
with younger children, eh? You have had
some experience of them, perhaps, Margaret?"</p>

<p>Was he still joking? Margaret had not
much sense of humour, and she was sadly
puzzled again.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I love little children," she said.
"Of course I do, Uncle John!"</p>

<p>"Little children,&mdash;yes. But how about
boys? Active, noisy, happy-go-lucky boys?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Boys that smash windows, and yell, and tear
their clothes on barbed-wire fences? How
about those, Margaret?"</p>

<p>"Is that the kind of boy you were, Uncle
John?" asked Margaret, smiling. "Because
if so, I am sure I shall like them very much."</p>

<p>"Very well, my dear child!" he said.
"You are well and happy, and we understand
each other, and that is all right, very
right. Now, Margaret,&mdash;I ask this for form's
sake merely,&mdash;have you been in this room
before, to-day?"</p>

<p>"No, Uncle John," said Margaret.</p>

<p>"Of course you have not. Knew it before
I asked you. Do you notice anything
unusual in the appearance of the room, my
dear?"</p>

<p>Margaret looked about her, wondering. It
produced an impression of&mdash;well, not just the
perfect order in which it was generally to be
found. Several drawers were half open; a
sheaf of papers lay on the floor, as if
dropped by a startled hand. The writing
things were disarranged, slightly, yet noticeably;
for Mr. Montfort always kept them in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
one position, which was never changed save
when they were in actual use.</p>

<p>"Why, it looks&mdash;as if&mdash;as if you had
been in a hurry, Uncle John," she said at last.</p>

<p>"It looks as if <i>some one</i> had been in
a hurry," said Mr. Montfort, significantly.
"I have not been in this room before,
to-day; I found it in this condition. Never
mind, my dear! I am going to write a letter
now. Don't let me keep you any longer."</p>

<p>Margaret went away, wondering much; her
uncle joined her soon, and they looked at the
roses together, and chatted as usual, and were
happy, till Cousin Sophronia rapped on the
window with her thimble, and asked whether
they were coming in, or whether she should
come out and join them.</p>

<p>She was trying that evening, Cousin Sophronia.
Nothing on the tea-table suited her,
to begin with. She declared the beef tea
unfit to touch, and desired Mr. Montfort to
taste it, which he politely but firmly refused
to do. "But it is not fit to eat!" cried the
lady. "I insist on your tasting it, my dear
John."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear Sophronia, I am extremely sorry
it is not to your taste. If it is not good,
I certainly do not want to taste it. Send it
away and ask me to taste something that is
good."</p>

<p>The chicken was tough. "You should
change your butcher, John. Or are these
your own fowls? Chickens I will not call
them; they must be two years old at least.
Nothing disagrees with me like tough poultry.
Nobody to look after the fowls properly, I suppose.
I must take them in hand; not that I
have had any experience myself of fowls, but
an educated person, you understand. So important,
I always say, to bring educated intelligence
to bear on these matters. And then,
these knives are so dull! Even if the fowls were
tender, impossible to make an impression with
such a knife as this. Elizabeth, what do you
use for your knives?"</p>

<p>Elizabeth used Bristol brick, as she always
had done.</p>

<p>"Ah, entirely out of date, Bristol brick. You
must send for some of the preparation that
William uses, John. Nothing like it. Some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>thing
or other, it's called; somebody's&mdash;I
can't remember now, but we will have it,
never fear, dearest John. Shameful, for
you to be subjected to dull knives <i>and</i> tough
poultry. What are these? Strawberries?
Dear me! I did hope we could have raspberries
this evening. One is so tired of strawberries
by this time, don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry," said Mr. Montfort. "The
raspberries will be ripe in a day or two,
Sophronia; Willis thought they would hardly
do to pick to-day."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I assure you, my dearest John,
Willis is entirely wrong. I examined the
bushes myself; I went quite through them,
and found them quite&mdash;entirely ripe. That
was just Willis's laziness, depend upon it.
These old servants" (Elizabeth had gone
to get more cream, the lady having emptied
the jug on her despised strawberries) "are
too lazy to be of much use. Depend upon
it, John, you will know no peace until you
get rid of them all, and start afresh; I am
thinking very seriously about it, I assure you,
my dear fellow. Yes, I have been longing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
for days for a plate of raspberries and cream.
I have so little appetite, that whenever I <i>can</i>
tempt it a little, the doctor says, I must not
fail to do so. No more, dear, thank you! It
is of no consequence, you know, really, not
the least in the world; only, one can be of so
much more use, when one keeps one's health.
Ah, you remember what health I had as a
child, John! You remember the dear old days
here, when we were children together?"</p>

<p>"I remember them very well, Sophronia,"
said Mr. Montfort, steadily. "And speaking
of that, I am expecting some young visitors
here in a day or two."</p>

<p>Cousin Sophronia looked up with a jerk;
Margaret looked at her uncle in surprise;
he sipped his tea tranquilly, and repeated:
"Some young visitors, yes. They will interest
you, Sophronia, with your strong family
feeling."</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;who are they?" asked Miss Sophronia.
"Most ill-judged, I must say, to
have children here just now; who did you
say they were, John?"</p>

<p>"Cousin Anthony's children. They lost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
their mother some years ago, you remember;
I fancy Anthony has had rather a hard time
with them since. Now he has to go out West
for the rest of the summer, and I have asked
them to come here."</p>

<p>For once Miss Sophronia was speechless.
After a moment's silence, Margaret ventured
to say, timidly, "How old are the children,
Uncle John?"</p>

<p>"Really, my dear, I hardly know. Two
boys and a girl, I believe. I don't even
know their names; haven't seen their father
for twenty years. Good fellow, Anthony; a
little absent-minded and heedless, but a good
fellow always. I was glad to be able to oblige
him."</p>

<p>Miss Sophronia recovered her speech.</p>

<p>"Really, my dear John," she said, with an
acrid smile; "I had no idea you were such
a philanthropist. If Fernley is to become an
asylum for orphan relations&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sophronia!" said Mr. Montfort.</p>

<p>His tone was quiet, but there was something
in it that made the lady redden, and
check herself instantly. Margaret wondered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
what would become of her, if her uncle
should ever speak to her in that tone.</p>

<p>"I am sure I meant nothing!" said Miss
Sophronia, bridling and rallying again. "I
am sure there was no allusion to our dearest
Margaret. Absurd! But these children are
very different. Why, Anthony Montfort is
your second cousin, John. I know every
shade of relationship; it is impossible to
deceive me in such matters, John."</p>

<p>"I should not attempt it, my dear cousin,"
said Mr. Montfort, quietly. "Anthony <i>is</i>
my second cousin. I will go further to meet
you, and admit boldly that these children are
my second cousins once removed, and Margaret's
third cousins. Where shall we put them,
Margaret?"</p>

<p>"My dearest John," cried Miss Sophronia,
in her gayest tone, "you are not to give it a
thought! Is he, Margaret? No, my dear
fellow! It is noble of you&mdash;Quixotic, I must
think, but undeniably noble&mdash;to take in
these poor little waifs; but you shall have no
further thought about providing for them.
Everything shall be arranged; I know the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
house from garret to cellar, remember. I
will make every arrangement, dearest John,
depend upon me!"</p>

<p>The evenings were not very gay at Fernley
just now. Miss Sophronia could not keep
awake while any one else read aloud; so she
took matters into her own hands, and read
herself, for an hour by the clock. Her voice
was high and thin, and kept Mr. Montfort
awake; she was apt to emphasise the wrong
words, which made Margaret's soul cry out
within her; and she stopped every few minutes
to chew a cardamom seed with great
deliberation. This simple action had the effect
of making both her hearers extremely nervous,
they could not have explained why.
Also, she was afflicted with a sniff, which
recurred at regular intervals, generally in
the middle of a sentence. Altogether the
reading was a chastened pleasure nowadays;
and this particular evening it was certainly
a relief when she declared, before the hour
was quite over, that she was hoarse, and must
stop before the end of the chapter. On the
whole, she thought it might be better for her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to go to bed early, and take some warm drink.
"It would never do for me to be laid up,
with these children coming to be seen after!"
she declared. So she departed, and Margaret
and her uncle sat down to a game of backgammon,
and played slowly and peacefully,
lingering over their moves as long as they
pleased, and tasting the pleasure of having
no one say that they should play this or that,
"of course!"</p>

<p>The game over, Mr. Montfort leaned back
in his chair, with an air of content.</p>

<p>"This is pleasant!" he said, slowly. "Margaret,
my dear, this is very pleasant!"
Margaret smiled at him, but made no reply.
None was needed: the uncle and niece were so
much alike in tastes and feelings, that they
hardly needed speech, sometimes, to know
each other's thoughts. Both were content to
sit now silent, in the soft, cheerful candle-light,
looking about on the books and pictures that
they loved, and feeling the silence like a
cordial.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mr. Montfort's air of cheerful
meditation changed. He sat upright, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
leaned slightly forward. He seemed to listen
for something. Then suddenly, softly, he
rose, and with silent step crossed the room
and stood a moment beside the wall. It was
a very different face that he turned to Margaret
the next instant.</p>

<p>"My dear," he said, "there is some one in
my study."</p>

<p>"In your study, Uncle John? What do you
mean? That is,&mdash;how can you tell, uncle?"</p>

<p>"Come here, and listen!" said her uncle.
Margaret stole to his side, and listened, her
head, like his, near the wall. She heard the
crackling of paper; the sound of a drawer
pulled softly out; the clank, muffled, but unmistakable,
of brass handles. What did it
mean? She looked to her uncle for explanation.
He shook his head and motioned her
to be silent. Then, taking her hand in his,
he led her softly from the room. Margaret
followed, greatly wondering, across the wide
hall; through the low door that led to the
White Rooms, now her own; into her own
sitting-room, or Aunt Faith's room, as she
still loved to call it. Here Mr. Montfort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
released her hand, and again motioned her to
be silent.</p>

<p>"I will explain by and by, my dear," he
said. "Follow me, now, and learn another
lesson in Fernley geography; I was keeping
it for a surprise some day, but never mind.
Where is this place?"</p>

<p>Margaret noticed, in all her confusion of
surprise, that the great white chair was
pushed away from its usual place. Her uncle
stepped in behind the table near which it
always stood, and passed his hand along the
smooth white panel of the wall. Noiselessly
it swung open, revealing a dark space. Margaret
obeyed his gesture, and following, found
herself in a narrow passage, carpeted with
felt, on which her feet made no sound. They
went forward some way; it was quite dark,
but she followed her uncle's guidance, and he
trod as surely as if it were broad daylight.
Presently he stopped, and, with a pressure of
the hand, bade her listen again. The rustling
of paper sounded very clear now; there
was another rustle, too, the rustle of silk.
Suddenly, light flashed upon them; Margaret<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
felt herself drawn swiftly forward; there was
a smothered exclamation in her uncle's voice,
followed by a scream from another.</p>

<p>They were standing in Mr. Montfort's study.
The room was lighted by a single candle, that
stood on the writing-table; beside this table,
backed against it in an attitude of terror and
surprise, stood Miss Sophronia Montfort, her
hands full of documents, her eyes glaring.
There was a moment of silence, and Margaret
counted her heart-beats. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Can I be of any assistance to you, my
dear Sophronia?" asked Mr. Montfort, blandly.
"You seem in distress; allow me to relieve
you of some of these." He took the papers
quietly, and laid them on the table. Miss
Sophronia gasped once, twice; opened and
shut her eyes several times, and swallowed
convulsively; when she spoke, it was with a
fluttering voice, but in something like her
ordinary tone.</p>

<p>"My dear John! How you startled me!
A&mdash;a&mdash;little surprise for you, my dear
fellow. Such a shocking condition as your
papers were in. I thought&mdash;a kindness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>&mdash;to
bring a little order out of chaos; he! he!
ahem! my throat is troublesome to-night. A
warm drink! Yes, my dear John, I remembered
the old passage, you see. I said, why
should I disturb the dear fellow, to ask him
for the key to the outer door? And really,
John, these papers are too&mdash;too bad!"</p>

<p>She shook her head in a manner that was
meant to be playful; but suddenly the smile
dropped from her face like a mask; for Mr.
Montfort did a singular thing. He bent his
head forward slightly; fixed his eyes on his
cousin with a peculiar expression, and advanced
slowly, one step. "Sophronia!" he said.</p>

<p>Miss Sophronia began to tremble.</p>

<p>"Don't, John!" she cried. "John Montfort,
don't do it! I am your own cousin.
Your father and mine were brothers, John. I
hope I know my duty&mdash;ah, don't! I will
not, John Montfort!"</p>

<p>Margaret looked from one to the other in
blank amazement. The lady seemed in the
extremity of terror. Her uncle&mdash;was this
her uncle? Instead of the grave, dignified
gentleman, she seemed to see a boy; a boy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
intent on mischief, every motion of him alive
with power and malice. Step by step he
advanced, his hands clenched, his head bent
forward, his eyes still fixed, bright and strong,
on his cousin.</p>

<p>"Sophronia!" he said, "I am coming!
Sophronia! Sophronia! Sophronia!" Each
time he quickened voice and step. He was
almost upon her; with one wild shriek Miss
Sophronia turned and fled. Her skirts whisked
along the secret passage; they heard the door
bang. She was gone.</p>

<p>Mr. Montfort sat down in his study chair
and laughed long and silently.</p>

<p>"Don't look so frightened, my dear!" he
said, at last. "It was a scurvy trick, but she
deserved it. I&mdash;I used to run Sophronia up-stairs,
Margaret, when she was a troublesome
girl. It always frightened her. I'd have
done it in another minute, if she had not run,
but I knew she would. Poor Sophronia! I
suppose something of the boy stays in us, my
dear, as long as we live. I&mdash;I am afraid I
should rather have enjoyed running Sophronia
up-stairs."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>THE DAUNTLESS THREE.</h3>


<p>The next morning Miss Sophronia kept her
bed; her cold, she said, was too severe to admit
of her joining the family at breakfast.
Margaret waited on her with an uneasy sense
of guilt in general, though she could not accuse
herself of any special sin. She did her
best to be sympathetic and dutiful, having
been brought up to respect her elders sincerely.
But she was puzzled all the same,
and when it came to any question between
her cousin and her uncle, there were no more
doubts. She must put herself out of the way
as much as possible, and give up, wherever
her own pleasure was concerned,&mdash;where it
was any matter connected with Uncle John,
she would be the Rock of Gibraltar. This
being settled, the Rock of Gibraltar brought
raspberries for Cousin Sophronia's breakfast,
and made her room bright with flowers, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
tried to make cheer for her. The poor lady
was rather subdued, and told Margaret she
was a cherub child; then declared she would
not be a burden on any one, and sent the girl
away to "amuse herself."</p>

<p>"Be happy as a butterfly, my dear, all the
morning; don't give me a thought, I beg
of you. If Frances would have a new-laid
egg ready for me at eleven&mdash;positively a
new-laid one, Margaret! Perhaps you would
bring it yourself from the hen-yard. I have
no confidence in servants, and it would make
a pleasant little trip for you. So important,
I always say, for the young to have something
useful to mingle with their sports.
Boiled three minutes and a half, my love!
I doubt if I can eat it, but it is my duty to
make the attempt. Bless you! Good-bye!
If you happen to have nothing to do about
twelve, you might bring your work and sit
with me. I am the most sociable creature in
the world; I cannot endure to be alone when
I am ill; but don't have me on your mind,
my love, for a single instant."</p>

<p>All the duties attended to, Margaret spent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
a delightful hour, with Elizabeth's assistance,
in making ready the rooms for the newcomers.
The little girl was to have Peggy's
room, next her own, and that needed nothing
save fresh flowers in the vases, and fresh ribbons
on the curtains. But the boys were to
have the old nursery, the great room that ran
across the whole width of the house, on the
third floor. It was a pleasant room, with
dormer windows facing east and south, a
great fireplace, with a high wire fender,
and a huge sofa, covered with red chintz
dragons. A funny sofa it was, with little
drawers let in along the sides. John Montfort
and his brothers used to lie on this sofa,
when they had the measles and whooping-cough,
and play with the brass drawer-handles,
and keep their treasures in the
drawers. The windows were barred, and
there was a gate across the landing, at the
top of the stairs. Elizabeth had suggested
taking away the gate and the bars, "such
big young gentlemen as these would be, most
likely, sir!" but Mr. Montfort shook his head
very decidedly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"If they are Montfort boys, Elizabeth, they
will need all the bars we can give them.
Master Richard was twelve, when he squeezed
himself between these, and went along the
gutter hanging by his hands, till he came
to the spout, and shinned down it. Never
make things too easy for a Montfort boy!"</p>

<p>In one corner stood a huge rocking-horse,
with saddle and bridle of crimson leather,
rather the worse for wear. He was blind
of one eye, and his tail had seen service, but
he was a fine animal for all that. Margaret
hunted about in the attic, and found a box of
ninepins. Marbles, too; Uncle John had told
her that there must be marbles somewhere, in
a large bag of flowered purple calico, with a
red string. They had been there forty years;
they must be there still. She found them at
last, hanging from a peg of one of the great
beams. On the beam close by was written:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This is my Peg. If any Pig touches my Peg,
that Pig will be Pegged. Signed, <span class="smcap">John Montfort</span>."</p></div>

<p>"Oh," thought Margaret, "what a pleasant
boy Uncle John must have been! What good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
times we should have had together!" And
then she reflected that he could not possibly
have been so nice a boy as he was an uncle,
and was content.</p>

<p>The marbles, and the rocking-horse, and&mdash;what
else ought there to be? Tops! Uncle
John had said something about tops. Here
Margaret screamed, and fled to the attic door.
Something was moving on the beam by which
she had been standing, perched on a chair.
Something rolled slowly along, half the length
of the beam, and dropped to the floor and
rolled towards her. Laughing now, Margaret
stooped and picked up a great ball, a
leather ball, striped red and black. On one
of the red stripes was written, in large, unconventional
letters, "Roger." It was her
father's ball! Margaret held the toy very
tenderly in her hands, and tried to see the
worn, thoughtful face she remembered so
well, a rosy boy's face, full of light and
laughter. She had seen, yesterday, strangely
enough, her uncle's boyish looks, revealed in
a flash of mischief; it was less easy to see
her father's.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>As she stood meditating, the sound of
wheels was heard outside. Margaret ran
to look out of the little gable window, then
clapped her hands together, in amazement
and pleasure. The children had come!</p>

<p>When she reached the verandah, they were
already standing there, facing Mr. Montfort,
who had come out by an early train, and was
standing looking at them with amused attention,
holding the little girl's hands in his.</p>

<p>"And what are your names, my dears?"
he was saying.</p>

<p>"Basil, Merton, and Susan D.," replied the
elder boy, promptly, while three pairs of sharp
eyes were fastened on the strange uncle.</p>

<p>"Battle, Murder, and Sudden Death!" said
Mr. Montfort under his breath. He had no
idea that any one could hear him, but a shriek
of laughter startled him, and made Margaret
jump.</p>

<p>"That's what Puppa calls us!" cried Basil,
springing lightly up and down on the tips
of his toes. "We didn't know whether you
would or not; he said you would pretty soon,
anyhow. How do you do, Uncle John? We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
are very well, thank you. I am thirteen, and
Mert is twelve, and Susan D. is ten. Puppa
hopes we shall not be troublesome, and here
are the keys of the trunks."</p>

<p>The boy drew a long breath, and looked
round him with an air of triumph.</p>

<p>"Well, I should think you would know
it!" said his brother. "Been saying it all
the way over here."</p>

<p>"More than you could do!" retorted his
elder.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't do it anyhow, so there!" said
the younger.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 270px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;THE LITTLE GIRL HAD NEVER STIRRED, BUT STOOD GAZING UP AT THE BIG MAN WHO HELD HER HANDS.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>These last remarks had been carried on in
an undertone, the set speech having been
delivered slowly and with much dignity.
Finally each boy kicked the other's shins
surreptitiously, and then both stared again
at their uncle. The little girl had never
stirred, but stood gazing up at the big man
who held her hands so lightly and yet so
kindly, and who had such bright, deep, quiet
brown eyes. Margaret, standing in the doorway,
scrutinised the three, and felt a sinking
at the heart. Basil Montfort was a tall boy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
for his age, slender and wiry, with tow-coloured
hair that stood straight on end, thin lips that
curled up at the corners with a suggestion of
malice, and piercing gray eyes, which he had
a trick of screwing up till they were like gimlet
points. The second, Merton, was decidedly
better-looking, with pretty curly hair, and blue
eyes with an appealing look in them; but
Margaret fancied he looked a little sly; and
straightway took herself to task for the unkind
fancy. The little girl was Basil over
again, save that the tow-coloured hair was put
back with a round comb, and the gray eyes
widely opened, instead of half shut, when she
looked at any one. All three children were
neatly dressed, and all looked as if they were
not used to their clothes.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Montfort at last, after a
long, silent look at each one in turn, "I am
very glad to see you, children. I hope we
are going to be good friends. Boys, I was
a boy myself, just two or three years ago,&mdash;or
it may be four,&mdash;so you can ask me about
anything you want to know. Susan, I never
was a girl, you see, but that need not make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
much difference. Your Cousin Margaret&mdash;oh,
here <i>is</i> your Cousin Margaret! She will
be good to you, and&mdash;and in short, you are
all very welcome to Fernley, and there is a
swing in the garden, and the rest you can
find out for yourselves."</p>

<p>Margaret came forward, and shook hands
with the boys, and kissed the little girl
warmly. Evidently Susan D. was not used to
being kissed, for she blushed, and her brothers
giggled rather rudely, till they caught Mr.
Montfort's eye, and stopped.</p>

<p>"Young gentlemen," said Uncle John, with
an emphasis which brought the blood to
Basil's cheek, "dinner will be ready"&mdash;he
looked at his watch&mdash;"in an hour. I daresay
they would like something now, Margaret;
crackers and cheese, gingerbread,&mdash;what?
You'll find them something." Mr.
Montfort nodded kindly, and strode away to
his study. Margaret was left alone with the
three strange children, feeling shyer than
ever before in her life. The meeting with
the three cousins of her own age, two years
ago, was nothing to this.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you hungry, boys?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Starving!" said Merton.</p>

<p>"He isn't," said Susan D. "He's been
eating all the way, ever since we left home.
He's a greedy,&mdash;that's what he is." Then,
scared at her own voice, she hung her head
down, and put her finger in her mouth.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said Margaret, "I daresay you
would all be hungry before dinner-time, so
suppose we come into the pantry and see
what we can find. Will you come with me,
Susan, dear?" She held out her hand, but
the little girl evaded it, and followed in the
rear, holding her own hands behind her back.</p>

<p>"Will you call me Cousin Margaret?" the
girl went on. "And shall I call you Susie,
or do you like Susan better?"</p>

<p>Susan not replying, Basil replied for her.
"Susan D. we call her; but Puppa calls her
Sudden Death when she acts bad; she mostly
does act bad."</p>

<p>"Don't neither!" muttered Susan D., scowling.</p>

<p>"Do teither!" retorted both brothers in a
breath.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"She ain't shy!" Basil went on. "She's
sulky, that's all. Merton's shy, and I ain't.
I'll tell you things, when you ask me; they
won't, half the time."</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't asked you anything, yet,
have I?" said Margaret, smiling, and feeling
more at ease with this boy, somehow, than
with either of the others. "What can you
tell me that is pleasant about them?"</p>

<p>"That's so!" said Basil, and his lips parted
suddenly in a smile that positively transfigured
his plain face. "Well, Mert's the
best boxer, and he can sing and draw. I'm
the best runner, of course, 'count of my legs
being long, you see." He held up a long,
thin leg for Margaret's inspection. "Some
fellows called me Spider once, and Susan D.
scratched their faces for 'em. She's great
at scratching, Susan D. is."</p>

<p>"My dear!" said poor Margaret. "I
thought you were going to tell me the
pleasant things, Basil."</p>

<p>"Ain't I?" said the boy, innocently. "She
was standing up for me, you see. She always
stands up for me; Mert is a sne&mdash;&mdash; well, what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
I was going to say, she's a pretty good runner,
for a girl, and she can shin a rope too, better
than any of us. Mert can hang on longest
with his teeth."</p>

<p>"What <i>do</i> you mean, child?" cried Margaret,
laughing. Basil flashed his brilliant
smile on her again.</p>

<p>"Tables," he explained. "Yes, please,
crackers; and quite a lot of cheese, please."</p>

<p>"Greedy Gobble!" interjected Merton.</p>

<p>"Well, I like that!" said Basil. "Who
ate my sandwich, when I was looking out of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: This word is not present in the original text">the</ins>
window? I tell you what, I'd punch your
head for two cents, young feller!"</p>

<p>"Boys," said Margaret, decidedly, "I cannot
have this! While you are with me, I
expect you to behave decently."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am!" said both boys, with ready
cheerfulness; and Basil continued his explanation.</p>

<p>"We see which can hang on to a table
longest, don't you know, by your teeth. Did
ever you?"</p>

<p>"No, I certainly never did; and&mdash;I don't
think you'd better try it here, Basil. It must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
be very hard on your teeth, besides ruining
the table."</p>

<p>"It ain't healthy for the table," Basil
admitted. "You ought to see the tables at
home! It makes like a little pattern round
the edge, sometimes. Quite pretty, I think.
Say, are you the boss here?"</p>

<p>Seated on the pantry dresser, swinging his
legs, the young gentleman seemed as much at
home as if he had spent his life at Fernley.
The two other children were eating hastily
and furtively, as if they feared each bite
might be their last. Basil crunched his
crackers and nibbled his cheese with an air
of perfect unconcern. "Are you the boss
here?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Am I in authority, do you mean?" asked
Margaret, who could not abide slang of any
kind. "No, indeed, Basil. Your Uncle John
is the head of the house, in every possible
way. I hope you are all going to be very
good and obedient. He is the kindest, best
man in the whole world."</p>

<p>"I think he's bully," said Basil. "I guess
you're bully too, ain't you? And it's a bully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
place. Hi, Mert, there's a squirrel! Look at
him running up that tree. My! Wish I had
a pea-shooter!"</p>

<p>"Bet you couldn't hit him if you had!"
cried Merton, as all three children watched
the squirrel with breathless interest.</p>

<p>"Bet I could!" said Basil, contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Guess he could hit it when you couldn't
hit a barn in the next county!" cried Susan
D. in a kind of small shriek; then she caught
Margaret's eye, blushed furiously, and tried
to get behind her bread and butter.</p>

<p>"I say! can we go out in the garden?"
cried Basil.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, but wouldn't you like to
come up and see your rooms first? Such
pleasant rooms! I am sure you will like
them."</p>

<p>But none of the children cared to see the
pleasant rooms. Receiving permission to play
till they heard the dinner-bell, they fled
suddenly, as if the constable were at their
heels. Margaret saw their legs twinkling
across the grass-plot. They were yelling like
red Indians. Susan D.'s hat blew off at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
third bound; Basil shied his cap into a bush
with a joyous whoop, then snatched off his
brother's and threw that after it. Merton
grappled him with a shout, and they rolled
over and over at the feet of their sister, who
bent down and pummelled them both with
might and main, shrieking with excitement.
As Margaret gazed aghast, preparing to fly
and interfere, she heard a quiet laugh behind
her, and turning, saw Mr. Montfort looking
over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Battle, Murder, and Sudden Death!" he
said. "Separate them? On no account, my
dear! They have been shut up for hours,
and their muscles need stretching. Don't be
alarmed, my child; I know this kind." Poor
Margaret sighed. She did not know this
kind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>THE FIRST CONQUEST.</h3>


<p>When Margaret went to bed that night,
she felt as if she had been whipped with
rods. Head, heart, and back, all ached in
sympathy. The children were in bed; that
is, she had left them in bed; their staying
there was another matter; however, all three
were tired after their journey, and Uncle John
thought the chances were that they would fall
asleep before they had time to think of doing
anything else. Among the three, the little
girl was the one who oppressed Margaret with
a sense of defeat, a sense of her own incompetence.
She had not expected to understand
the boys; she had never had any experience
of boys; but she had expected to win the little
girl to her, and make her a little friend,
perhaps almost a sister. Susan D. received
her advances with an elfish coldness that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
had something not human in it, Margaret
thought. The child was like a changeling,
in the old fairy stories. That evening, when
bedtime came, Margaret went up with her
to the pretty room, hoping for a pleasant
time. She sat down and took the little girl
on her knee. "Let us have a cuddle, dear!"
she said; "put your head down on my shoulder,
and I will sing you one of my own
bedtime songs, that my nurse used to sing
to me."</p>

<p>Susan D. sat bold upright, not a yielding
joint in all her body.</p>

<p>"Don't you like songs?" asked Margaret,
stroking the tow-coloured hair gently.</p>

<p>"No!" said the child; and with the word
she wriggled off Margaret's lap, and stood
twisting her fingers awkwardly, and frowning
at the floor. Margaret sighed.</p>

<p>"Then we will undress and get to bed," she
said, trying to speak lightly. "You must be
very tired, little girl. Isn't that a pretty bed?
Is your bed at home like this? Tell me about
your room, won't you, Susie?"</p>

<p>But Susan D. still twisted her fingers and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
frowned, and would not say a single word.
She made no resistance, however, when Margaret
helped her off with her clothes. "You
are big enough to undress yourself, of course,"
the girl said, "but I will help you to-night,
because you are tired, and you must feel
strange, coming so far away from home.
Poor little mite!" The child looked so
small and slight, standing with her dress
off, and her thin shoulders sticking out
like wings, that Margaret felt a sudden
thrill of compassion, and stooping, kissed
the freckled cheek warmly. The colour came
into the child's face, but she stood like a stock,
never moving a muscle, never raising her eyes
to take note of the pretty, tasteful arrangements
to which Margaret had given such
thought and pains. But the undressing
went on, and presently she was in her little
nightgown, with her hair unbraided and
smoothly brushed. She might be pretty,
Margaret decided, when she filled out a
little, and had a pleasanter expression. She
was so little! Surely there must be one more
effort, this first night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shall I hear you say your prayers, dear?"
asked Margaret, taking the child's two hands
in hers. Susan D. shook her head resolutely.</p>

<p>"No? You like better to say them by yourself?
Then I will come back in a few minutes,
and tuck you up in your little nest."</p>

<p>The child gave no sign; and when Margaret
came back, she was standing in the
same spot, in the same position. She got
into bed obediently, and made no resistance
when Margaret tucked the bedclothes in,
patted her shoulder, and gave her a last
good-night kiss. She might as well have
kissed the pillow for any response there
was, but at least there had been no shrinking
this time. "Good night, Susan D.," said
Margaret, cheerfully, pausing at the door.
"Good night, dear! Susan, I think you must
answer when you are spoken to."</p>

<p>"Good night!" said Susan D. Margaret
shut the door softly and went away. As
she passed along the corridor that ran
round the hall, something struck her forehead
lightly. She looked up, and narrowly
escaped getting a fish-hook in her eye. Mer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>ton
looked over the banisters, and smiled appealingly.
"I was fishin'," he said. "There's
fish-lines in the drawers of the sofa. I guess I
'most caught a whale, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"Merton, you must go to bed at once!" said
Margaret. "How long have you been standing
there in your nightgown? You might
catch your death." (It had been one of old
Katy's maxims that if you stood about in
your nightgown for however short a time,
you inevitably got your death. Margaret
had never doubted it till this moment.) "I
am coming up now to tuck you both up!"
she added, with a happy inspiration.</p>

<p>There was a hasty scuffle, then a rush,
accompanied by smothered squeals. When
Margaret reached the nursery, both boys
were in bed. Merton's blue eyes were wide
open, and fixed on her with mournful earnestness;
Basil was asleep, the clothes tucked
in well under his chin. He lay on his back,
his mouth slightly opened; he was snoring
gently, but unobtrusively. Poor child! no
doubt he was tired enough. But how had
Merton managed to make so <i>much</i> noise?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Margaret looked around her, and Merton's
gaze grew more intense. His own clothes
lay in a heap on the floor, but where were
his brother's? And&mdash;and what was that,
smoothly folded over the back of a chair?
A clean nightgown?</p>

<p>But when Merton saw his cousin's eyes fix
on the nightgown, he exploded in a bubbling
laugh. "He&mdash;he ain't undressed at all!"
he cried, gleefully. "He never! he's got his
boots on, and every single&mdash;" The speech
got no further. There was a flying whirl of
blankets, a leap, and Basil was on his brother's
chest, pounding him with right good will.
"You sneak!" he cried. "I'll teach you&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was no time to think; the child
would be killed before her eyes. Margaret
took a firm hold on Basil's collar, and dragged
him off by main strength, he still clawing the
air. Unconsciously, she gave him a hearty
shake before she let go; the boy staggered
back a few paces; who would have thought
that Margaret had such strength in her slender
wrists? The crisis over, she panted, and
felt faint for an instant; Basil, after a moment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of bewilderment, looked at her, and the smile
broke all over his face, a moment before black
with rage.</p>

<p>"Got me that time, didn't you?" he said,
simply. "He's a mean sneak, Mert is. I'll
serve him out to-morrow, don't you be
afraid!"</p>

<p>"Basil, what does this mean?" asked
Margaret, severely. "Why are you not in
bed?" Then as Basil sent an eloquent glance
at the pillow where his head had been lying
so quietly, she added, "Why are you not
undressed, I mean? I am afraid you have
been very naughty, both of you, boys."</p>

<p>"Well, you see," said Basil, apologetically,
"there was all kinds of things in the drawers,
and then I got on the rocking-horse, and it
wasn't but just a minute before you came up.
I say, isn't this a bully room, Cousin Margaret?
I think Uncle John was awfully good
to give us such a room as this. Why doesn't
he sleep here himself? Bet I would, if I
owned the house. I say, do those marbles
belong to him?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Margaret, smiling in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
spite of herself; "yes, I am sure they were
his. But now, Basil,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, see here!" cried the boy, excitedly.
"Because, you see, they're worth a lot, some
of 'em. Why, there's agates,&mdash;why, they
are perfect beauties! Just look!" He ran
towards the sofa, but Margaret stopped him
resolutely.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, Basil!" she said. "To-morrow
you shall show me everything you like; but
now you must go to bed, this very moment.
I am pretty tired, but I shall sit outside on
the landing, till you tell me that you are in
bed; then I shall come in and make sure for
myself, and tuck you in."</p>

<p>Basil illuminated the room again. "Will
you?" he cried. "Honest, will you tuck us
in?"</p>

<p>Margaret nodded, wondering, and withdrew
to the landing, where she sat with her
head in her hands, saying to herself, "Let
nothing disturb thee, nothing affright thee&mdash;"</p>

<p>Basil spoke through the keyhole. "Cousin
Margaret!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Basil; are you ready so soon?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, not quite. I wanted to say,&mdash;do you
think you ought to spank me?"</p>

<p>"No, certainly not, my dear!"</p>

<p>"'Cause you can, if you think you'd better."</p>

<p>"No, no, Basil; only do get to bed, like a
good boy!"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>A sudden plunge was heard, a thump, and
the agonised shriek of a suffering bedstead.
"Now I'm in bed!" said Basil. Margaret
picked up the two heaps of clothing, and laid
them neatly on two chairs. "I want you to
do this yourselves after this," she explained.
"It isn't nice to leave your things on the floor."</p>

<p>"All right!" "We will!" said both boys;
and then they joined in a fervent appeal to
her not to turn their knickerbockers upside
down. "'Cause all the things in your pockets
spill out," said Merton.</p>

<p>"And then you get 'em mixed, and can't
tell what belongs where," cried Basil.
"Thank you, Cousin Margaret; that's bully!"</p>

<p>Margaret tucked Merton in first; he looked
so dimpled and pretty, she was tempted to
offer a caress, but the recollection of Susan D.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
kept her from it. Turning away, she came to
Basil's bed. The boy watched her intently as
she smoothed the bedclothes with practised
hand, and tucked them in exactly right, not
too tight and not too loose. There are several
ways of tucking a person into bed. With a
pleasant "Good night!" she was about to
leave him, but something in the boy's face
held her. "Is there anything you want, my
dear?" she asked, gently. Basil looked at
her; then turned his head away. "Mother
used to put me to bed!" he muttered, so low
that Margaret could hardly hear. She did
hear, however; and instantly stooping over
the boy, she kissed him warmly. Thank
Heaven, here was one who did want to be
loved. "Dear Basil," she said, tenderly.
"Dear boy, you shall tell me all about her
some day. Will you?" The boy nodded;
his eyes were eloquent, but he did not speak.
Her heart still warm, Margaret looked across
at Merton; but Basil plucked her gown and
whispered, "He&mdash;doesn't know. He can't
remember her. Perhaps you can teach
him&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Margaret nodded, kissed the boy's white
forehead once more, and went away with a
lighter heart than she had brought with her.
On the floor below she paused to listen at
Susan's door; all was quiet there. Cousin
Sophronia was asleep, too, no doubt; Margaret
had spent part of the evening with her, reading,
and listening to her doleful prophecies of
the miseries entailed by the coming of "these
dreadful children!" It was nearly her own
bedtime, too, for between Cousin Sophronia
and the children the evening had slipped away
all too fast. But surely she might have a few
minutes of peace and joy? The library door
stood open; from it there came a stream of
cheerful light, and the perfume of a Manila
cigar. Oh, good! Uncle John had not gone
to his study; he was waiting for her. As she
passed Miss Sophronia's door, Margaret fancied
she heard a call; but she was not sure,
and for once she was rebellious. She flew
down-stairs, and ran into the library.</p>

<p>The pleasant room lay in shade, save for
the bright gleam of the reading-lamp. Among
the books which lined the walls from floor to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
ceiling, the gilded backs of the smaller volumes
caught the light and sent it back in soft,
broken twinklings; but the great brown folios
on the lower shelves were half lost in a comfortable
duskiness. The crimson curtains were
drawn before the open windows, and the evening
wind waved them lightly now and then,
sending new shadows to chase the old ones
along the walls and ceiling. The thick old
Turkey carpet held every possible shade of
soft, faded richness, and the brown leather
armchairs looked as if they had been sat in by
generations of book-loving Montforts, as indeed
they had. And amid all this sober comfort,
by the great library table with its orderly
litter of magazines and new books, sat Mr.
John Montfort, book in hand and cigar in
mouth, a breathing statue of Ease, in a brown
velvet smoking-jacket. He looked up, and,
seeing Margaret in the doorway, laid down
his book, and held out his hand with a gesture
of welcome. "Well, my girl," he said,
"come and tell me all about it!"</p>

<p>With a great sigh of relief, Margaret
dropped on the rug at her uncle's feet, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
laid her tired head on his knee. "Uncle
John!" she said. "Oh, Uncle John!" That
seemed to be all she wanted to say; she shut
her eyes, and gave herself up to the comfort
which only comes with rest after fatigue.</p>

<p>Mr. Montfort stroked her hair gently, with
a touch as light as a woman's. Then he took
up his book again, and began to read aloud.
It was a curious old book, bound in black
leather, with great silver clasps.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In that isle is a dead sea or lake, that has no
bottom; and if any thing falls into it, it will never
come up again. In that lake grow reeds, which
they call Thaby, that are thirty fathoms long; and
of these reeds they make fair houses. And there
are other reeds, not so long, that grow near the land,
and have roots full a quarter of a furlong long or
more, at the knots of which roots precious stones
are found that have great virtues; for he who carries
any of them upon him may not be hurt by iron or
steel; and therefore they who have those stones on
them fight very boldly both by sea and land; and
therefore, when their enemies are aware of this, they
shoot at them darts without iron or steel, and so hurt
and slay them. And also of those reeds they make
houses and ships and other things, as we here make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
houses and ships of oak, or of any other tree. And
let no man think I am joking, for I have seen these
reeds with my own eyes."</p></div>

<p>The words flowed on and on; Margaret felt
her troubles smoothing themselves out, melting
away. "Who is this pleasant person?"
she asked, without raising her head.</p>

<p>"Sir John Mandeville," said her uncle.
"Rest a bit still, and we'll go and see the
Chan of Cathay with him. Here we are!"
He turned a page or two, and read again:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The emperor has his table alone by himself,
which is of gold and precious stones; or of crystal,
bordered with gold and full of precious stones; or
of amethysts, or of lignum aloes, that comes out of
Paradise; or of ivory bound or bordered with gold.
And under the emperor's table sit four clerks, who
write all that the emperor says, be it good or evil;
for all that he says must be held good; for he may
not change his word nor revoke it."</p></div>

<p>"Oh, but I shouldn't like that, Uncle
John!" cried Margaret. "I shouldn't like
that at all! Should you?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it would be agreeable," Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Montfort admitted. "But when we come to
anything we don't like, we can suppose that
Sir John was&mdash;shall we call it embroidering?
And how does my girl feel now? Are the
wrinkles smoothing out at all?"</p>

<p>"All smooth!" replied the girl. "All
gone, Uncle John. I was only a little tired;
and&mdash;Uncle John&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear child."</p>

<p>"You must expect that I shall do a great
many wrong things, at first. I am very ignorant,
and&mdash;well, not very old, perhaps. If
only I can make the children love me!"</p>

<p>"They'd better love you," said Uncle John.
"If they don't, they'll get the stick. But don't
fret, Margaret; I am not going to fret, and I
shall not let you do it. The little girl seems
slightly abnormal, at first sight; but the
boys&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle John?" and Margaret raised
her head and looked eagerly at her uncle,
hoping for some light that would make all
clear to her. "The boys?"</p>

<p>"Why, the boys are just boys, my dear;
nothing in the world but plain boys. Two of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
'em instead of four,&mdash;thank your stars that
you are in this generation instead of the last,
my love; and now take this little head off to
bed, and don't let another anxious thought
come into it. Good night, my child."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>A NEWCOMER.</h3>


<p>"If you please, Miss Margaret, the lady
would like to speak to you, in her room."</p>

<p>"Miss Montfort?" (Elizabeth never would
call Miss Sophronia Miss Montfort.) "Yes,
Elizabeth, I will be up in a moment; tell her,
please."</p>

<p>Hastily pinning her collar,&mdash;it was near
breakfast-time, and she had been longer than
usual in dressing,&mdash;Margaret ran up to the
Blue Room. Miss Sophronia, in curl-papers
and a long, yellow wrapper, was standing near
the window, apparently rigid with horror.</p>

<p>"What is it, Cousin Sophronia? What
can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"Margaret, I told you,&mdash;I warned you. I
warned John Montfort. No one can say
that I neglected my duty in this respect;
my conscience is clear. Now look,&mdash;I desire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
you, look out of that window, and tell me
what you think."</p>

<p>Margaret looked. At first she saw nothing
but the clear glass, and, beyond it, the blue
sky and waving trees. But, looking again,
she became aware of two objects dangling
over the upper part of the pane; a black
object, and a white object; two small legs,
one bare, the other in stocking and shoe.
The legs were swinging back and forth,
keeping time to a clear and lively whistle,
and now and then one of them gave a little
kick, as of pure content.</p>

<p>"Do you see?" demanded Miss Sophronia,
in tragic tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, Cousin Sophronia, I see. I can't
think&mdash;but I'll run up at once and see what
it means, and bring the child down. I&mdash;"
Margaret waited to say no more, but flew
up-stairs, only pausing to cast a hasty glance
into Susan D.'s room, the door of which
stood open. The room was empty; so, when
she reached the top of the stairs, was the
nursery. She entered a small room that
was used as a storeroom; its one window<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
looked directly on the roof, and this window
stood wide open. Running to look out,
Margaret saw Susan D., seated astride of a
gable, dangling her legs as aforesaid, and
apparently enjoying herself immensely. The
whistle stopped when she saw her cousin, and
the cheerful look gave place to one of sullenness.</p>

<p>"Susan, my dear child, what are you doing
here?"</p>

<p>"Looking for my other stocking," replied
the child.</p>

<p>"Your stocking?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I dropped it out of the window,
and I came up here to look for it."</p>

<p>"She thought she could see better!" explained
Basil, appearing suddenly from behind
the chimney. "I&mdash;good morning,
Cousin Margaret. I slept very well, thank
you."</p>

<p>"So did I!" chimed in Susan D., with
suspicious readiness. "I slept very well.
Good morning, Cousin Margaret, thank
you!"</p>

<p>"That isn't right," said Basil, as Mar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>garet
looked in bewilderment from one to
the other; "you are such a stupid, Susan D.
You see," he added, turning to Margaret,
"I've been telling her that she's got to
have better manners, and speak when she's
spoken to; and, if she behaves pretty well,
she's going to get some hard stamps she
wants; and if she doesn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am," said Susan D. "Amn't I, Cousin
Margaret?"</p>

<p>It was the first time the child had addressed
Margaret directly, and the latter
hastened to assure her that her morning
greeting would do very well indeed. "But,
dear children," she cried, "I cannot let you
stay here. Indeed, you ought never to have
come up; I don't believe Uncle John would
like to have you on the roof at all; and
it is breakfast-time, and Cousin Sophronia
has been a good deal frightened, Susie, at
seeing your legs dangling over her window
in this fashion."</p>

<p>"We aren't hurting the old roof!" cried
boy and girl, in eager self-defence.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dears! It isn't the roof, it's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
your precious necks, that you might be
breaking at this moment. How are you
going to get back? Basil, it makes me
dizzy to look at you."</p>

<p>"Then I wouldn't look," said Basil, cheerfully.
"I'm all right, Cousin Margaret, just
truly I am. Why, I just live on roofs, every
chance I get. And this is a bully roof to
climb on."</p>

<p>Margaret covered her eyes with her hands,
as the boy came tripping along the ridge-pole
towards her; but the next moment she put
the hands down resolutely. "Let me help
you!" she said. "Susan, take my hand,
dear, and let me help you in."</p>

<p>But Susan D. needed no helping hand; she
scrambled up the slope of the roof like a
squirrel, and wriggled in at the window
before Margaret could lay hands on her.
"I'm all right!" she said, shyly. "I didn't
find my stocking, though. I'll get another
pair." But Margaret soon found the stocking,
and in due time could report to Cousin
Sophronia that the children were both safe
on the ground, and more or less ready for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
breakfast. Merton had not shared in the roof
expedition; he had climbed the great chestnut-tree
instead, and appeared at breakfast
with most of the buttons off his jacket, and
a large barn-door tear in his knickerbockers.</p>

<p>Miss Sophronia greeted the children with
firmness. "How do you do, my dears?" she
said. "I am your Cousin Sophronia, and I
shall take the place of a mamma to you while
you are here. If you do as I tell you, we shall
get on very well, I dare say. You are Basil?
Yes, you look like your Uncle Reuben. You
remember Reuben, John? What a troublesome
boy he was, to be sure! And this is
Merton. H'm! Yes! The image of his
father. Anthony; to be sure! And what
is your name, child? Susan D.? Ah, yes!
For your Aunt Susan, of course. And are
you a good girl, Susan D.?"</p>

<p>Susan D. hung her head, and looked
defiant.</p>

<p>"Always answer when you are spoken to,"
said the lady, with mild severity. "I'm afraid
your father has let you run wild; but we will
alter all that. Little boy&mdash;Merton, I mean,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
you are taking too much sugar on your porridge.
Too much sugar is very bad for children.
Hand me the bowl, if you please.
I am obliged to take a good deal of sugar&mdash;the
doctor's orders! There are one&mdash;two&mdash;three
buttons off your jacket. This will
never do!"</p>

<p>"I scraped 'em off, shinning up the tree,"
said Merton, sadly. "I barked all my shins,
too; but I found the squirrel's nest."</p>

<p>"Oh, Merton, you didn't meddle with it?"
cried Margaret. "That little squirrel is so
tame, I should be very sorry to have him
teased. You didn't tease him, did you,
dear?"</p>

<p>Merton looked injured. "I just put my
hand into his old hole, and he bit me, nasty
thing! I'll kill him, first chance I get."</p>

<p>"You will do nothing of the kind," said
Mr. Montfort, quietly. "You will let the
squirrel alone, Merton, or I shall have to
stop the climbing altogether. You understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Merton. "Ow! you stop
that, now!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you speak to me, sir?" inquired Mr.
Montfort, politely.</p>

<p>"Well, he kicked my sore shin," growled
Merton, glaring savagely at Basil. Basil
chuckled gleefully. Mr. Montfort looked
from one to the other.</p>

<p>"Kick each other as much as you like out-of-doors,"
he said. "Here, you can either
behave yourselves or leave the table. Take
your choice." He spoke very quietly, and
went on with his letter, without another
glance at the boys; indeed, no second glance
was needed, for the children behaved remarkably
well through the rest of breakfast.</p>

<p>That morning was a trying time for Margaret.
She tried hard to remember her
uncle's parting words, as he drove away:
"Let them run, these first few days, and
don't worry; above all, don't worry!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 272px;">
<img src="images/gs05.png" width="272" height="400" alt="&quot;MERTON WAS TEASING CHIQUITO.&quot;" title="&quot;MERTON WAS TEASING CHIQUITO.&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;MERTON WAS TEASING CHIQUITO.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Yes, but how could she help worrying? If
it had been only running! But these children
never seemed content to stay on their feet for
ten minutes together. Now they were turning
somersaults round and round the grass-plot,
till her head grew dizzy, and Cousin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Sophronia screamed from the window that
they would all be dead of apoplexy in less
than ten minutes. Now they were hanging
by their heels from the lower branches of the
horse-chestnut tree, daring each other to turn
a somersault in the air and so descend. Now
Merton was teasing Chiquito, and getting his
finger bitten, and howling, while Basil jeered
at him, and wanted to know whether a sixty-year-old
bird was likely to stand "sauce"
from a ten-year-old monkey. Now Susan D.
had caught her frock on a bramble, and torn
a long, jagged rent across the front breadth,
that filled Margaret with despair. Poor
Susan D.! By afternoon, Miss Sophronia
had taken her into custody, and marched
her off to her own room, to stay there till
bedtime.</p>

<p>"The child was rebellious, my dear Margaret;
positively disrespectful. A little discipline,
my love, is what that child needs. It is
my duty to give it to her, and I shall do my
duty cheerfully. At your age, it is not to be expected
that you should know anything about
children. Leave all to me, and you will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
surprised at the result. A firm rein for a few
weeks,&mdash;I shall manage her, never fear!"</p>

<p>Margaret was humble-minded, and fully
conscious of her total lack of experience; still,
she could not feel that a system of repression
was the one most likely to succeed with
Susan D.</p>

<p>"If we could win the child's affection," she
began, timidly. Miss Sophronia pounced upon
her.</p>

<p>"My love, you naturally think so! Believe
me, I know what I am talking about. I have
practically brought up William's children;
the result is astonishing, everybody says
so." (Everybody did, but their astonishment
was hardly what the good lady fancied it.)
"Trust,&mdash;dearest Margaret, simply confide
absolutely in me! So important, I always
say, for the young to have entire confidence
in their elders."</p>

<p>Margaret was thankful when dinner was
over, and her cousin gone to take her afternoon
nap. Basil was in a lowering mood,
the result of his sister's imprisonment. He
would do nothing but rage against Cousin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Sophronia, so Margaret was finally obliged to
send him away, and sit down with a sigh
to her work, alone.</p>

<p>It was very pleasant and peaceful on the
verandah. The garden was hot and sunny at
this hour, but here the shade lay cool and
grateful, and Margaret felt the silence like
balm on her fretted spirit. It was all wrong
that she should be so fretted; she argued with
herself, scolded, tried to bring herself to a
better frame of mind; but nature was too
strong for her, and the best she could do was
to resolve that she would try, and keep on trying,
her very best; and that Uncle John
should not know how worried she was. That,
surely, she could manage: to keep a smiling
face when he was at home, and to made light
of all these hourly pin-pricks that seemed to
her sensitive nature like sword-thrusts.</p>

<p>So quiet! Only the sound of the soft wind
in the great chestnut-trees, and the clear notes
of a bird in the upper branches. A rose-breasted
grosbeak! Her uncle had been
teaching her something about birds, and she
knew this beautiful creature, and loved to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
watch him as he hovered about the nest
where his good wife sat. His song was
almost like the oriole's, Margaret thought.
She laid down her embroidery, and watched
the flashes of crimson appear and disappear.
What a wonderful, beautiful thing! How
good to live in the green country, where
lovely sights and sounds were one's own, all
day long. Why should one let oneself be
distressed, even if things did not go just to
one's mind?</p>

<p>A soft cloud seemed to be stealing over her
spirit; it was not sleep, but just a waking
dream, of peace and beauty, and the love of
all lovely things in the green and blossoming
world, where life floated by to the music of
birds,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Miss Margaret; were
you asleep, miss?"</p>

<p>Margaret sat upright, and looked a little
severe. It would never do even to look as if
she had been asleep, in the middle of the afternoon.
"No, Elizabeth," she said. "What is
wanted?"</p>

<p>"Only miss, Frances was wishful to know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
whether she should keep Master Merton's dinner
any longer, or whether she'd cook something
fresh for him along with his supper."</p>

<p>No more dreaming for Margaret! She
sprang to her feet, suddenly conscious of the
fact that Merton had not been seen for several
hours. It could not have been more than
eleven o'clock when he was in her room;
now&mdash; "What time is it, Elizabeth?"</p>

<p>"Going on five, Miss Margaret. Mr. Montfort'll
soon be here, miss; maybe Master
Merton might have gone to meet him."</p>

<p>Margaret shook her head; that did not
seem at all likely. She hailed Basil, who
came sauntering up the gravel walk, his
brow still clouded, kicking the pebbles before
him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Basil, have you seen Merton? He
has not been in the house since this morning,
and I am anxious about him."</p>

<p>Basil shrugged his shoulders. "Run away,
most likely!" he said, carelessly. "He's
always running away, Mert is."</p>

<p>"Always running away! But where could
he run to, Basil? He does not know his way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
about here. He surely would not run away
in a strange place."</p>

<p>Basil smiled superior. "That's just why
he'd do it. He likes to find out new places;
we both do. I wouldn't leave Susan D., or
I'd have gone, too, bet I would. No use
staying here, to be bossed round."</p>

<p>"Oh, Basil, don't talk so, but help me, like
a dear boy, to find Merton."</p>

<p>Basil stood uncertain. He raised a threatening
glance towards Miss Sophronia's window;
but Margaret was beside him in a moment.
"Basil, to please me!" she said. She laid
her hand on the boy's shoulder. He stood
still, and Margaret had a moment of painful
doubt; but the next instant he raised his face
to her with his own enchanting smile. "All
right!" he said. "You are all right, Cousin
Margaret, whatever other folks are, and I'll
help you every single bit I can."</p>

<p>"That's my good, helpful boy!" said Margaret,
heartily. "Oh, Basil, you and I together
can do a great deal, but alone I feel
rather helpless. You shall be my little&mdash;no,
not little&mdash;you shall be my brother, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
tell me how to manage Merton and Susan, and
make them love me. But the first thing is to
find Merton. What can have become of the
child? Where shall we look for him?"</p>

<p>"I think perhaps down by the bog," said
Basil, looking very important and pleased
with his new responsibility. "He said he
was going down there, first chance he got.
I meant to go, too, but I won't if you don't
want me to, Cousin Margaret. There's a
bully&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Basil!"</p>

<p>"There's a&mdash;a superb workman down
there; do you know him, Cousin Margaret?
I guess he's the boss, or something. He wears
blue overalls and a blue jumper, and he can
vault&mdash;oh my! how that fellow can vault!"</p>

<p>"Basil, I don't feel at all sure that your
uncle would wish you to be talking with
strange workmen. At any rate, I think you
ought to ask leave, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Maybe I ought!" said Basil, cheerfully.
"But it's too late now, you see, 'cause I have
talked to him, quite lots, and he's awfully
jolly. Oh, Jonah! I do believe there he is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
now; and&mdash;Cousin Margaret! I do believe
he's got Mert with him! Look!"</p>

<p>Margaret looked. A man was coming
across the field that lay beyond the garden
wall; a workingman, from his blue overalls
and jumper; a young man, from the way he
moved, and from his light, springy step.
Margaret could not see his face, but his hair
was red; she could see that over the burden
that he carried in his arms.</p>

<p>Coming nearer, this burden was seen to be
a child. A chimney-sweeper? No, for chimney-sweepers
are not necessarily wet; do not
drip black mud from head to foot; do not
run streams of black bog water.</p>

<p>"Merton!" cried poor Margaret, who knew
well the look of that mud and water. "Oh,
what has happened? Is&mdash;is he hurt?" she
cried out, running towards the wall.</p>

<p>The young workman raised a cheerful face,
streaked with black, and presenting the appearance
of a light-hearted savage in trim for
a funeral.</p>

<p>"Not a bit hurt!" he called in return.
"All right, only wet, and a trifle muddy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Little chap's had a bath, that's all. Hope
you haven't been anxious about him."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I have been anxious&mdash;thank you!
You are sure&mdash;he has not been in danger?"</p>

<p>"Well," the stranger admitted, "just as
well I was there, perhaps. It isn't a safe
place for children, you see. How are you
now, old chap? He was a bit dizzy when I
picked him up, you see."</p>

<p>Merton lifted his black head, and looked
ruefully at Margaret.</p>

<p>"You told me not to go!" he said. "I
won't go again."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you won't!" cried Basil,
excitedly. "Why, you've been in all over; it's
all up to your chin, and some of it's on the
back of your head. I say, you must&mdash;"</p>

<p>The young man made him a sign quickly.
"He's all right!" he said. "Mud baths extremely
hygienic; recommended by the medical
fraternity; a&mdash;where did you say I should
put him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon!" cried Margaret.
"I am letting you hold him all this time, and
you are getting all wet, too."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>"No consequence, not the least in the world.
Besides,&mdash;past participle perhaps more appropriate
than present."</p>

<p>Margaret led the way to the verandah, and
the stranger finally deposited his burden on
the steps. Looking down at himself, he
seemed for the first time aware of his singular
appearance, for he blushed, and, lifting
his cap, was turning away with a muttered
apology, in which the word "clothes" was
the only word Margaret could hear.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried, "you are not going yet!
I&mdash;I have not thanked you! You have
saved the child's life, I know you have. I&mdash;I
have seen something of that bog," she
shuddered. "Mr. Montfort will want to see
you, and thank you himself. Do at least tell
me your name, so that we may know who it is
that has done us this great service."</p>

<p>But here the young man caught sight of his
face, reflected in a window-pane, and lost the
last vestige of self-possession. "If&mdash;if you'll
excuse me," he cried, "I think I'll go before
Mr. Montfort comes. The costume of a Mohawk
on the war-path&mdash;effective, but unusual;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
a&mdash;call to-morrow if I may, to see if the
little chap is all right. Mr. Montfort kindly
asked me&mdash;good day!"</p>

<p>"But you haven't told her your name!"
Basil shouted after him.</p>

<p>"Oh! Of course!&mdash;a&mdash;Merryweather!
Gerald Merryweather."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>"I MUST HELP MYSELF."</h3>


<div class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">Dear Margaret</span>:

<p>"I find a telegram here which obliges me to run on
to Philadelphia at once. I may be away all the week;
do as well as you can, dear child, and don't let B., M.,
and S. D. tear you to pieces. I forgot to tell you
that the young man in charge of the bog-draining
turns out to be the son of an old friend of mine,
Miles Merryweather. I asked him to come up to
the house; if he should come while I am away, you
will be good to him. I will let you know by telegraph
when to expect me.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">"Always affectionately yours,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">John Montfort.</span>"<br />
</div>
</div>

<p>Margaret read this brief letter with a sinking
heart. How was she to keep up without
Uncle John? How was she to cope with all
the difficulties that beset her path like sharp-thorned
briers? If she had but Aunt Faith<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>&mdash;if
she had but some one to turn to! She had
tried to take counsel with Mrs. Peyton, but
the beautiful woman was still, at fifty, a spoiled
child, far younger in many ways than Margaret
herself; she would only laugh, and
advise her to get rid of Miss Sophronia by
some trick, or practical joke.</p>

<p>"Freeze her out, my dear! Get rid of her,
somehow! That is all the advice I can give
you. And bring the young barbarians to see
me; I am sure they will amuse me."</p>

<p>Margaret had just been acting on this last
request. She had taken the two boys to see
the invalid, and had left them there now, coming
away with a sore and angry heart. Mrs.
Peyton had been drawing the children out,
laughing at their remarks about their cousin,
and paying no regard to Margaret's entreaties.
At length Margaret had simply come away,
with no more than a brief "Good afternoon!"
feeling that she could not trust herself to say
more. Emily Peyton only laughed; she had
full confidence in her charm, and thought she
could bring back her puritanical little friend
whenever she chose to smile in a particular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
way; meanwhile, the children were a new toy,
and amused her.</p>

<p>But Margaret felt that she had had almost
enough of Mrs. Peyton. Beauty was a great
deal, charm and grace were a great deal more;
but they did not take the place of heart. No,
there was no one to help her! Well, then she
must help herself, that was all!</p>

<p>She stood still, her mind full of this new
thought. She was eighteen years old; she
was well and strong, and possessed of average
intelligence. "Look here!" she said suddenly,
aloud. "If you cannot manage those children,
why, I am ashamed of you. Do you
hear?"</p>

<p>The other self, the timid one, did hear, and
took heart. The girl felt new strength coming
to her. The world had changed, somehow;
the giants,&mdash;were they only windmills,
after all? Up, lance, and at them!</p>

<p>In this changed mood she went on, humming
a little song to herself. As she drew
near the wood that skirted the bog, the song
was answered by another, trolled in a cheerful
bass voice:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"The lady was pleased for to see him so bold;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">She gave him her glove that was flowered with gold;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">She said she had found it while walking around,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As she was a-hunting with her dog and her gun."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>The "blue boy," as she mentally called him,
came dancing out of the wood, throwing up
his cap, and singing as he came. At sight of
Margaret he paused, in some confusion, cap
in hand.</div>

<p>"I&mdash;I beg your pardon," he said. "I trust
I did not disturb you with my carol? There
isn't generally any one here, you know; I get
rather to feel as if it all belonged to me. I
hope the little chap is all right to-day, Miss&mdash;Is
it Miss Montfort?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Certainly!" said Margaret,
blushing in her turn. "I ought to have said,
of course&mdash;yes, thank you, Mr. Merryweather,
Merton is quite well to-day; and I really think
he has had a lesson, for he has not run away
since, and it is two or three days ago. I&mdash;my
uncle has been suddenly called away on
business, but he asked me to say&mdash;that is, we
shall be very glad to see you at the house any
day; Miss Montfort, his cousin,&mdash;my uncle's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
cousin,&mdash;is there with me and the children."</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully," murmured Gerald. "I'd
like to come ever so much, some day; but I
keep all in a mess so&mdash;" he glanced down
ruefully at his blue clothes, and finding them
quite respectably clean, brightened visibly.
"My father was at school with Mr. Montfort;
Miles Merryweather, perhaps he told you,
Miss Montfort?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he told me. I&mdash;I always think
Uncle John must have been such a delightful
boy. I am sure they must have had good
times together."</p>

<p>"So was the Pater, no end; I mean, my
father was an agreeable youth also." Gerald
stopped short, and glanced sidelong at
the young girl. He was well used to girls,
having sisters and cousins; but they were used
to him, too, and he somehow felt that this
sweet, serious-looking maiden was not accustomed
to young men, and that he must, as he
silently put it to himself, "consider the prudent
P, and the quaintly quiggling Q."</p>

<p>"And Uncle John must have been a bril<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>liant
scholar!" Margaret went on, warming
to her subject. She had never, as it happened,
walked and talked with a lad before in her
quiet life; she did not know quite how to do
it, but so long as she talked about Uncle John,
she could not go wrong. "He knows so much,&mdash;so
much that he must have learned early,
because it is so a part of him. Wasn't he
head of his class most of the time? He never
will talk about it, but I am sure he must have
been."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure about that," Gerald
admitted; "I know he was the best wrestler,
and that he and my father were generally
neck and neck in all the running races. He
was a better high kick, because his legs were
longer, don't you know, but the Pater was
ahead in boxing."</p>

<p>Margaret was bewildered. Was this scholarship?
Was this the record that brilliant
boys left behind them? She gave a little
sigh; the mention of long legs brought her
back to Basil again. Dear Basil! he had only
one pair of knickerbockers left that was fit
to be seen. She ought to be mending the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
corduroys this moment, in case he should come
home all in pieces, as he was apt to do.</p>

<p>"Have you any little brothers, Mr. Merryweather?"
she asked, following the thread of
her thought.</p>

<p>"One; Willy. That is, he's not so very
little now, but he's a good bit younger than
Phil and I; Phil is my twin. Willy&mdash;oh, I
suppose he must be fourteen, or somewhere
about there, to a field or two."</p>

<p>"Basil is twelve," said Margaret, thoughtfully.
"And does he&mdash;or did he, two years
ago,&mdash;I suppose a boy develops very quickly,&mdash;did
he want to be climbing and jumping
and running <i>all</i> the time?"</p>

<p>"Let me see!" said Gerald, gravely. "Why&mdash;yes,
I should say so, Miss Montfort. Of
course he stops now and then to eat; and then
there's the time that he's asleep, you know;
you have to take out that. But otherwise,&mdash;yes,
I should say you had described Willy's
existence pretty well."</p>

<p>"And climbing on roofs?" Margaret went
on. "And tumbling into bogs, and turning
somersaults? What <i>can</i> be the pleasure of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
turning oneself wrong side up and getting the
blood into one's head?"</p>

<p>Margaret stopped suddenly, and the colour
rushed into her face; no need of somersaults
in her case. For had not this young man
been turning somersaults the first time she
saw him? And turning them in the same
senseless way, just for the joy of it, apparently?
She glanced at him, and he was
blushing too; but he met her look of distress
with one so comic in its quizzical appeal, that
she laughed in spite of herself.</p>

<p>"I love to turn somersaults!" he murmured.
"'Twas the charm of my chirping
childhood; it is now the solace of my age.
Don't be severe, Miss Montfort. I turn them
now, sometimes; I will not deceive you."</p>

<p>"Oh! oh, yes, I know!" said Margaret,
timidly, but still laughing in spite of herself.
"I&mdash;I saw you the other day, Mr. Merryweather.
I thought&mdash;you seemed to be enjoying
yourself very much."</p>

<p>"No! Did you, though?" cried Gerald. "I
say! Where was it? I never meant to do it
when people were round. I'm awfully sorry."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Margaret, confused. "Why
shouldn't you? It&mdash;it was by the edge of
the bog. I had come round that way, and
you were leaping with a pole about the bog,
and I&mdash;stayed to watch you. I hope you
don't mind;" this foolish girl was blushing
again furiously, which was most unnecessary;
"and&mdash;I thought you must be
a foreigner; I don't know why. And&mdash;and
then you came out, and turned a somersault,
and&mdash;I wondered why, that was all. You
see, I never had a brother, and I have never
known any boys in all my life till now. I
don't mean that you are a boy, of course!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but I <i>am!</i>" cried Gerald. "What
else am I but a boy? I wish they could hear
you at home. Why, I'm just Jerry, you know,
and&mdash;and I've always been that kind of boy,
I'm afraid; just like Willy, only a good deal
worse. And now&mdash;well, I've been through
college, and now I'm in the School of Mines,
and I'm twenty-one, and all that, but I can't
seem to make myself feel any older, don't you
know. I don't know what's going to become
of me. Hilda says I won't grow up till I fall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>&mdash;oh!
you don't know Hilda, do you, Miss
Montfort?"</p>

<p>"Hilda?" repeated Margaret. "I only
know Hilda in the 'Marble Faun.'"</p>

<p>"Hildegarde Merryweather; Hildegarde
Grahame she used to be. I thought you
might possibly have&mdash;well, she's my aunt
according to the flesh. I wish you did know
her!"</p>

<p>"Your aunt? Is she&mdash;is she about Uncle
John's age? I know so few people, you see.
I have lived a very quiet life."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! She&mdash;well, I suppose she's a
little older than you, but not very much.
She married Roger, don't you know. He's
my half-uncle all right, but he's ever so many
years younger than the Pater, nearer our age,
you might almost say; and Hildegarde and
the girls, my sisters,&mdash;I say! I wish you
knew them all, Miss Montfort."</p>

<p>"I wish I did," said Margaret, simply.
"There are no girls of my own age near
here. Last year I had my cousins, and I
miss them so much!"</p>

<p>"Of course you must!" said sympathetic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Gerald. "Girls are no end&mdash;I&mdash;I mean,
I like them too, ever so much." He paused,
and wished he knew the right thing to say.
How pretty and sweet she was! Not like
Hilda, of course (Hilda was this young man's
ideal of what a girl should be), but with a
little quiet way of her own that was very
nice. She must have no end of a time of it
with these youngsters! He spoke his thought
aloud. They were nearing Fernley, and he
must leave her soon. "You must be having
some difficulty with those youngsters, Miss
Montfort. If I could help you any time, I
wish you'd let me know. There have always
been such a lot of us at home, I'm used to
most kinds of children, you see; and I should
be ever so glad&mdash;"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 270px;">
<img src="images/gs06.png" width="270" height="400" alt="&quot;&#39;Won&#39;t you come in?&#39;&quot;" title="&quot;&#39;Won&#39;t you come in?&#39;&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;Won&#39;t you come in?&#39;&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Oh, thank you!" said Margaret, gratefully.
"I am sure you are very kind; and
if you would advise me sometimes&mdash;now
that Uncle John is away&mdash;I should be most
grateful. But&mdash;I ought to be able to manage
them myself, it seems to me, without help.
If I can only make them love me!" She
looked straight at Gerald, and her dark gray<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
eyes were very wistful in their unconscious
appeal.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see 'em not!" said the young
man, straightway. "Little beggars! They
couldn't help themselves!" He was about
to add that he would thrash them handsomely
if they did not love her, but pulled
himself together, and blushed to his ears, and
was only comforted by seeing out of the tail
of his eye that the girl was wholly unconscious
of his blushes. After all, there was
some sense in freckles and sunburn.</p>

<p>But here they were now at the gates of
Fernley. "Won't you come in?" said Margaret.
But Gerald, becoming once more
conscious of his working-clothes, which he
had entirely forgotten, excused himself. If
he might come some evening soon? Yes, he
might, and should. He lingered still a moment,
and Margaret, after a moment's shyness, held
out her hand frankly. "I am so glad to know
you!" she said, simply. "Uncle John&mdash;Mr.
Montfort said I was to be good to you, and
I will try."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you couldn't be anything else!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
said Gerald, with fervour. "Thanks, awfully,
Miss Montfort. Good-bye!" Lifting his cap,
the young man turned away, feeling homesick,
and yet cheerful. Passing round the
corner of the house, and finding himself well
out of sight of the young girl, he relieved his
feelings by turning a handspring; and on
coming to his feet again, encountered the
awful gaze of two greenish eyes, bent upon
him from an upper window of the house.</p>

<p>"Now I've done it!" said the youth, brushing
himself, and assuming all the dignity of
which he was master. "Wonder who that
is? Housekeeper, perhaps? Quite the Gorgon,
whoever it is. Wish I didn't turn over
so easily."</p>

<p>Margaret went into the house singing, with
a lighter heart than she had felt since Uncle
John's letter came. Perhaps she had made
a friend; at any rate, a pleasant acquaintance.
What a frank, nice, gentlemanly&mdash;boy! "For
he is a boy, just as he says!" she acknowledged
to herself. And what kind, honest
eyes he had; and how thoughtful to offer to
help her with the children!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Her pleasant meditations were harshly interrupted.
Miss Sophronia came down-stairs,
with her brown and yellow shawl drawn over
her shoulders; this, Margaret had learned,
was a bad sign.</p>

<p>"Margaret, who was that young man? I
saw you! There is no use in attempting to
conceal anything from me, my dear. I saw
you talking with a young man at the gate."</p>

<p>"Why should I conceal it?" asked Margaret,
wondering. "It was Mr. Merryweather,
Cousin Sophronia. He was a
schoolmate of Uncle John's,&mdash;I mean his
father was."</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense!" cried the lady,
sharply. "Don't tell me anything of the
kind, miss. He was a common workman,
a day-labourer. I tell you I saw him! Do
you suppose I have no eyes in my head? I
shall consider it my duty to tell your uncle
as soon as he comes home. I am surprised at
you, Margaret. I thought at least you were
discreet. William's daughters would no more
think of talking with such a person&mdash;but
that comes of leaving a young person alone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
here with servants. My dear, I shall make
it a point henceforward&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped; for the gentle Margaret
turned upon her with eyes of fire. "Cousin
Sophronia, I cannot listen to this; I will not
listen! I am a gentlewoman, and must be
spoken to as a gentlewoman. I am eighteen
years old, and am accountable to no one except
Uncle John for my behaviour. Let me pass,
please! I want to go to my room."</p>

<p>The girl swept by, her head high, her
cheeks burning with righteous wrath. Miss
Sophronia gazed after her speechless; it was
as if a dove had ruffled its wings and flown in
her face. "Ungrateful girl!" said the lady
to herself. "I never meet with anything but
ingratitude wherever I go. She is as bad as
those girls of William's, for all her soft looks.
The human heart is very, very depraved. But
I shall do my duty, in spite of everything."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>THE SECOND CONQUEST.</h3>


<p>The boys came home late for tea that
night, bubbling over with joy. Basil declared
that they did not want any supper.
"Mrs. Peyton gave us some of her supper.
I say, Cousin Margaret, isn't she bully?"</p>

<p>"Basil, if you <i>could</i> find another adjective
now and then! I cannot imagine anything
less appropriate to Mrs. Peyton than&mdash;the
one you used."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, it doesn't matter! She <i>is</i>
bully! She had broiled chicken, a whole
one, and she just took a little piece off the
breast for herself, and then she told Mert and
me each to take a leg and run. And we did!
And Mert sat down in the china bath-tub
with his, and smashed it,&mdash;cracked it, at
least,&mdash;and she said she didn't care."</p>

<p>"And the table-drawer was full of choco<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>late
peppermints," chimed in Merton, "and
we ate so many, I don't feel very well now, I
think, p'r'aps."</p>

<p>"And she told us lots of things!" cried
Basil again; he looked towards Miss Sophronia,
with sparkling eyes. "She told us
about when she was a little girl, and used
to stay here, when Uncle John's puppa and
mumma were alive. I say! And you were
here, too, she said, Cousin Sophronia. And
she said&mdash;lots of things!" The boy stopped
suddenly, and gave his brother a look of
intelligence.</p>

<p>"Ho!" said Merton, "I know what you
mean,&mdash;you mean about the ghost, that
scared&mdash;I say! You stop pinching, will
you? I'll punch your&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Merton!" said Margaret, warningly.</p>

<p>"Well, he was pinching me!" whined
Merton. "And it did scare you, didn't it,
Cousin Sophronia?"</p>

<p>Miss Sophronia looked disturbed. "Merton,
you should speak when you are spoken
to!" she said, severely. "I am surprised
that Mrs. Peyton should have told you such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
things. There certainly were some very
strange occurrences at Fernley, Margaret,
when I was a young girl. They never were
explained to my satisfaction; indeed, I never
heard of their being explained at all. Little
boys, if you do not want any supper, you
may as well run away. I do not approve
of their going to see Emily Peyton,
Margaret. I shall make a point of their
not doing so in future. She was always
malicious."</p>

<p>She seemed much fluttered, and Margaret,
wondering, hastened to change the subject.
"I wonder where Susan D. can be. I have
not seen the child since I came in, and she
did not answer when I called her. Elizabeth,
do you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Margaret, my love!" Miss
Sophronia interposed. "Susan D. is in bed;
I sent her to bed an hour ago."</p>

<p>"Oh, Cousin Sophronia! Without her
supper? What had she done?"</p>

<p>"She was disobedient, my dear,&mdash;disobedient
and impertinent. I have no doubt
that this will have an excellent effect upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the child. Basil, what do you want? I
told you to go away."</p>

<p>"Cousin Margaret, could I speak to you
a moment, please?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"I will come to you, Basil," said Margaret,
quickly. "Will you excuse me, Cousin Sophronia,
please? I have quite finished.
Now, Basil, what is it?"</p>

<p>She led the boy carefully out of earshot,
for thunder and lightning were in his face,
and she foresaw an outburst.</p>

<p>"Susan D. is in bed!" cried Basil. "She has
had no supper at all; Elizabeth said so. That
woman sent her. Cousin Margaret, I won't
stand it. I&mdash;I'll set fire to her clothes! I'll
shoot her! I'll&mdash;I'll kill her some way&mdash;"</p>

<p>Margaret laid her hand over the boy's
mouth. "You will be silent!" she said.
"Not a word, not a syllable, till you can
speak like a civilised being. We will have
no savages here."</p>

<p>Basil said no word,&mdash;he knew well enough
when he must obey,&mdash;but he set his teeth,
and clenched his fists; the veins on his
temples swelled, his whole childish frame<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
shook with anger. Margaret had never
seen any one, not even Rita, in such a passion
as this. For a few moments, the two
stood motionless, facing each other. Then
Margaret took the boy's hand in hers, and
led him out into the garden. Still holding
his hand, she paced up and down the
green walk in silence, Basil following obediently.
The evening was falling soft and
dusk; the last bird was chirping sleepily;
the air was full of the scent of flowers.
Behind the dark trees, where the sun had
gone down, the sky still glowed with soft,
yellow light. "See!" said Margaret, presently.
"There is the first star. Let us
wish! Oh, Basil dear, let us wish&mdash;and
pray&mdash;for a good thing, for strength to
overcome&mdash;ourselves."</p>

<p>The boy's hand pressed hers convulsively,
but he did not speak at first. Presently he
said, almost in a whisper, "She is so little,&mdash;and
so thin! I told Mother I would take
care of her. But&mdash;I said&mdash;I would try not
to let go of myself, too."</p>

<p>Very tenderly Margaret drew the child<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
down beside her, on a rustic bench that
stood under one of the great tulip-trees.
In the quiet darkness, she felt his heart
open to her even more than it had done
yet. In the hour that followed, she learned
the story of a wild, faithful nature, full of
mischief, full of love. The passionate love
for his mother, whom he remembered well;
the faithful, scowling devotion to the little
sister, whom no one should scold but himself,
and whom he shook, and bullied, and
protected with a sole eye to her good; all
this, and much more, Margaret learned. The
two sat hand in hand, and took counsel
together. "Oh, it is so good to have some
one to talk to," cried Basil.</p>

<p>"Isn't it, dear?" said Margaret. "Now
you know how I feel with Uncle John away;
and&mdash;oh, Basil, before I had Uncle John,&mdash;when
my father died,&mdash;oh, my dear! But
you are going to be my brother now, Basil,&mdash;my
dear, dear little brother, aren't you?
And you will tell me how to make Susan
D. love me. I think you do love me a little
already, don't you, Basil?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>For all answer, Basil threw his arms round
her, and gave her such a hug as made her gasp
for breath.</p>

<p>"Dear boy," cried Margaret, "don't&mdash;kill
me! Oh, Basil! I tried to hug Susan D.
the other day, and I might as well have
hugged the door! She won't even let me kiss
her good night; that is, she lets me, but there
is no response. Why doesn't she like me, do
you think?"</p>

<p>"She does!" said Basil. "Or she will,
soon as she can get out of herself. Don't you
know what I mean, Cousin Margaret? It's
as if she had a dumb spirit, like that fellow
in the Bible, don't you know? Nobody but
me understands; but you will, just once you
get inside."</p>

<p>"Ah, but how shall I ever get inside?"
said Margaret.</p>

<p>Basil nodded confidently. "You will!" he
said. "I know you will, some time. Oh,
Cousin Margaret, mayn't I take her something
to eat? She's always hungry, Susan D. is,
and I know she won't sleep a mite if she
doesn't have anything. I&mdash;no, I won't let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
go again, but it <i>is</i> the meanest, hatefullest
thing that ever was done in the world! Now
isn't it, Cousin Margaret? Don't you think
so yourself?"</p>

<p>Sorely puzzled as to the exact path of duty,
Margaret tried to explain to the boy how
ideas of discipline had changed since Cousin
Sophronia was a young girl; how, probably,
she had herself been brought up with rigid
severity, and, never having married, had kept
all the old cast-iron ideas which were now
superseded by wider and better knowledge and
sympathy. As to this particular point,
what should she say? Her whole kind nature
revolted against the thought of the hungry
child, alone, waking, perhaps weeping, with
no one to comfort her; yet how could she,
Margaret, possibly interfere with the doings
of one old enough to be her mother?</p>

<p>Pondering in anxious perplexity, she chanced
to raise her eyes to the house. It was brightly
lighted, and, as it happened, the curtains had
not been drawn. "Look!" said Margaret,
pressing the boy's hand in hers. "Basil,
look!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>One long, narrow window looked directly
upon the back stairs, which led from the servants'
hall to the upper floor. Up these
stairs, past the window, a figure was now seen
to pass, swiftly and stealthily; a portly figure,
carrying something that looked like a heaped
up plate; the figure of Frances the cook. It
passed, and in a moment more they saw light,
as of an opening door, flash into the dark
window of the corner room where the little
girl slept.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Basil," said Margaret, "I
wouldn't worry any more about Susan D.'s
being hungry. There is one person in Fernley
whom no one, not even Uncle John, can
manage; that is Frances."</p>

<p>An hour or so later, Margaret was coming
down from the nursery. Merton had announced,
as bedtime drew near, that he "felt
a pain;" and Margaret had no difficulty in
tracing it to Mrs. Peyton's careless indulgence.
She stole down quietly to the cheerful back
room where Frances and Elizabeth sat with
their sewing, and begged for some simple
remedy. Frances rose with alacrity. "Check<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>erberry
cordial is what you want, Miss Margaret,"
she said. "I've made it for thirty
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'year'">years</ins>, and I hope I know its merits. No
wonder the child is sick. If some had their
way, everybody in this house 'ud be sick to
starvation."</p>

<p>"I am afraid it was the other thing in this
case, Frances," said Margaret, meekly. "I'm
afraid Master Merton ate too many rich things
at Mrs. Peyton's." Now in general, Frances
could not abide patiently the mention of Mrs.
Peyton; but this time she declared she was
glad the child had had enough to eat for once.
"'Twill do him no harm!" she said, stoutly.
"Give him ten drops of this, Miss Margaret,
in a wine-glass of hot water,&mdash;wait a minute,
dear, and I'll mix it myself,&mdash;and he'll turn
over and go to sleep like a lamb. Treating
children as if they was one half starch and
t'other half sticks! Don't tell me!"</p>

<p>Knowing that none of this wrath was
directed against herself, Margaret wisely held
her tongue, and departed with her glass, leaving
Frances still muttering, and Elizabeth
with lips pursed up in judicious silence. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Merton took it and felt better, and was glad
enough to be petted a little, and finally to be
tucked up with the hot water-bottle for a comforter.</p>

<p>As has been said, Margaret was coming
down-stairs after this mission was fulfilled,
when she met Miss Sophronia coming up.
"All quiet up-stairs, my dear?" said the lady.
"I am going to bed myself, Margaret, for I
feel a little rheumatic, or I should rather say
neuralgic, perhaps. These things are very
obscure; the doctor says my case is a very remarkable
one; he has never seen another like
it. Yes, and now I am going to make sure
that this child is all right, and that she does
not actually need anything. Duty, Margaret,
is a thing I can never neglect."</p>

<p>Margaret followed her cousin into the room,
feeling rather self-reproachful. Perhaps she had
been unjust in her judgment. Cousin Sophronia
was of course doing the best, or what she
thought the best, for this poor wild little girl.</p>

<p>Miss Sophronia advanced towards the bed,
holding up her candle. Margaret, looking
over her shoulder, saw the child lying fast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
asleep, her hand under her cheek. Her face
was flushed, and her fair hair lay in a
tangle on the pillow. Margaret had never
seen her look so nearly pretty. There were
traces of tears on her face, too, and she sobbed
a little, softly, in her sleep.</p>

<p>"Poor little thing!" whispered Margaret;
but Miss Sophronia was not looking at Susan
D. now. With stiff, outstretched finger she
pointed to the floor. "Look at that!" she
said, in a penetrating whisper. Indeed, the
child had dropped her clothes on the floor all
at once, and they lay in an untidy heap,
shocking to Margaret's eyes, which loved to
see things neatly laid. She shook her head
and was about to murmur some extenuation
of the offence, when&mdash;Miss Sophronia set
down the candle on the stand; then, with a
quick, decided motion, she pulled the sleeping
child out of bed. "Susan D.," she said, "pick
up your clothes at once. Never let me find
them in this condition again. Shocking!"</p>

<p>The child stood helpless, bewildered, blinking,
half awake, at the light, not in the least
understanding what was said to her. Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Sophronia took her by the shoulder, not unkindly,
and repeated her command. "Pick
them up at once, my dear! Let this be a
lesson to you, never to leave your clothes on
the floor again." Still only half comprehending,
the child stooped, stumbling as she did
so, and picking up the clothes, laid them on
the chair as she was directed.</p>

<p>"There!" said Miss Sophronia, in high
satisfaction. "Now, my dearest Margaret,
you will see that this child will never neglect
her clothes again. A lesson promptly administered,
on the spot, is worth all the preaching
in the world. Get into bed again, Susan D.,
and go to sleep like a good child. Some day
you will be very grateful to your Cousin
Sophronia for teaching you these things."</p>

<p>She turned away with the candle. Margaret,
standing in the shadow, saw the child
still standing in the middle of the room, a
forlorn, shivering little figure, silent; the most
piteous sight those tender eyes had ever looked
upon. Softly the girl closed the door. "Margaret,"
she heard her cousin say. "Oh, she is
gone down-stairs!" and the steps went away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
along the entry. But Margaret groped her
way to where Susan D. stood; the next moment
she had the child in her arms, and was
pressing her close, close. A rocking-chair was
by; she had seen it, and knew where to
lay her hand to draw it forward. She sank
down in it, and rocked to and fro, murmuring
inarticulate words of comfort. The night was
warm, but still the child shivered; Margaret,
groping again, found a shawl, and wrapped it
round her. There was no more holding off,
no more resistance; the little creature clung
around Margaret's neck with a desperate hold,
as if she dared not let her go for an instant.
Her breast heaved once or twice, silently;
then she burst into a passion of tears, and
sobbed on her cousin's heart. "I love you!"
cried the child. "You are good, and I love
you! Don't&mdash;don't leave me alone, please
don't!"</p>

<p>Margaret held her close in her warm, loving
arms. "My lamb!" she said. "My little
girl! Indeed I will not leave you. Quiet
now, dearie; quiet and don't cry! Oh, Susan
D., I have no mother, either, dear; let us love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
each other a great, great deal!" and Susan D.
sobbed, and curled closer yet, as if she would
wind herself into the very heart that beat so
kindly and so tenderly.</p>

<p>So they sat, till the sobs died away into
soft, broken breathings. Margaret began to
sing, and crooned one after another the old
songs that Katy used to sing to her when she
was rocked just so on that broad, faithful
Irish breast. Susan D. lifted her head a little
towards her ear. "What is it?" said Margaret,
bending down.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I do like singing!" whispered the
child.</p>

<p>Margaret nodded, and sang on. By and by
the almost frantic clasp of the small arms
loosened; the head sank back gently on her
arm; the child was asleep. Margaret rose
to lay her down, but instantly she started up
again, affrighted, and cried out, and begged
not to be left alone. What was to be done?
Margaret hesitated; then she bade the child
hold fast, and slowly, carefully she made her
way down the stairs and through the passage
to her own room, and did not pause till the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
little child was lying safe, happy, and wondering,
in the white bed, in the wonderful White
Room.</p>

<p>"Crowd me?" said Cousin Margaret. "Not
a bit of it! There is plenty of room, and in the
morning we will have a most lovely cuddle,
and tell stories. But now go to sleep this very
minute, Susan D., while I do my hair. Good
night, little sister!"</p>

<p>"Good night!" said Susan D. "I love you!
Good night!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>THE VOICE OF FERNLEY.</h3>


<p>From that night, Susan D. was Margaret's
friend and true lover.</p>

<p>She followed her round in the hope of
being able to do some little service of love.
She brought her flowers, and hunted the
fields for the largest and finest berries for
her. At any hour of the day, Margaret
might feel a little hot hand slide into hers
and deposit a handful of warm, moist raspberries
or blueberries. Sometimes this bred
trouble, as when Merton waylaid his sister,
and wrested the hard-won treasures from her
for his own refreshment; with the result of
shrieks and scuffling, and a final thrashing
from his elder brother; or, as when Cousin
Sophronia detected the child sidling along
with closed palm, and demanded to see what
she had. Susan D. resisted stoutly, till at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
length, yielding to superior strength, she
threw the berries on the floor, and trampled
them into the carpet. There was a good deal
of this kind of thing; but still the change
was a blessed one, and Margaret, when she
met the beaming look of love in the child's
face, and remembered the suspicious scowl
that had greeted her only so few days ago,
was most thankful, and felt it to be worth
any amount of trouble, even to taking the
spots out of the carpet, which was a hard
thing to do.</p>

<p>"I told you!" said Basil, smiling superior.
"I told you, once you got inside, you'd find
the kid not at all so bad. I say, Cousin Margaret,
you're not a fraidcat, are you?"</p>

<p>"A what, Basil?"</p>

<p>"A fraidcat! Don't you know what a
fraidcat is, Cousin Margaret? Seems to me
you didn't learn many modern expressions
when you were a little girl, did you?"</p>

<p>"Really, Basil, I think I learned all that
were necessary," said Margaret, laughing.
"I did not learn slang, certainly, nor boy-jargon,
and I don't care to take lessons,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
thank you. Don't you think good, plain
English is good enough?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, it sounds all right from you,
'cause you are you, and you wouldn't match
yourself if you didn't talk that way, I suppose.
But it would sound silly for a boy to
go on so, don't you see?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid I don't see very well, Basil,
but no matter. The things I am afraid of are
spiders and caterpillars and cows! Is that
what you wanted to know?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;not exactly!" said the boy; "but
no matter, Cousin Margaret. You haven't
got a ball of twine, have you? Oh, yes,
please! Thank you, that is just exactly
what I wanted. You always know where
things are, don't you? That's bully!"</p>

<p>The children had been very good for the
last few days; singularly good, Margaret
thought, as she sat on the verandah in the
pleasant twilight, reviewing the day's doings,
and wondering what happy day would bring
Uncle John back to her. Certainly, he would
find a good deal of improvement. Merton
had not run away since his experience in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
bog; Susan D. was won, and Basil grew more
and more helpful and considerate. More than
that, the children, all three of them, seemed
to have quieted down of their own accord.
At this hour, they were generally shouting
and screaming, racing over the grass, or
tumbling headlong from the trees, keeping
Margaret in a constant state of terror, and
Cousin Sophronia in one of peevish irritation
and alarm. But now they had gone
of their own will to the summer-house, saying
that they were going to tell stories, and see
how quiet they could be. They were quiet,
indeed, for she could not even hear their
voices. Cousin Sophronia, coming out with
an inquiry, became instantly suspicious, and
declared she must go and see what they were
about; but Margaret begged her to wait a
little. "They can do no harm in the summer-house!"
she said. "And&mdash;Uncle John
thought we would better let them alone a
good deal, Cousin Sophronia."</p>

<p>"My love," said the lady, seating herself,
and folding her hands for a good talk, "your
Uncle John is a babe, simply a babe in these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
matters. Even if he knew anything about
children,&mdash;which he does not,&mdash;it would be
my duty, my positive duty, to shield him from
all anxieties of this kind. Why else did I
come here, my love, except for this very
thing?"</p>

<p>"Did you, then, know that Cousin Anthony
wished to send the children?" asked Margaret,
perhaps not without a spice of gentle
malice.</p>

<p>"Ahem! No, not precisely, my love!
But&mdash;but it was my firm resolve to protect
dearest John from every species of annoyance.
Every species, my dear! John Montfort&mdash;good
gracious! What is that?" She
started to her feet, and Margaret followed her
example. A sound seemed to pass them in
the air; a strange sound, something between
a sigh and a moan. It swelled for a moment,
then died away among the trees beyond the
verandah. Miss Sophronia clutched Margaret's
arm. "You&mdash;you made that noise?"
she whispered. "Say it was you, Margaret!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, it was not I, Cousin Sophronia!"
said Margaret. "It must have been a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
sudden gust of wind. It is gone now; it
must surely have been the wind. Shall I
bring you a wrap? Do you feel chilly?"</p>

<p>Miss Sophronia still held her arm. "No,
no! Don't go!" she said. "I&mdash;I feel rather
nervous to-night, I think. Nerves! Yes, no
one knows what I suffer. If you had any
idea what my nights are&mdash; You may be right,
my dear, about the wind. It is a misfortune,
I always say, to have such exquisite sensibility.
The expression is not my own, my love, it is
Doctor Soper's. Shall we go into the house,
and light the lamps? So much more cheerful,
I always think, than this dreary twilight."</p>

<p>Margaret hesitated a moment. The evening
was very warm, and once in the house, her
cousin would be sure to shut all the windows
and draw the curtains. Still, she must not be
selfish&mdash;</p>

<p>"If I join you in a few minutes, Cousin
Sophronia?" she said. "The children&mdash;I suppose
it is time for them to come in. I will just
go down to the summer-house and see&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sentence remained unfinished; for at
that moment, almost close beside them, arose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the strange moaning sound once more. This
time Miss Sophronia shrieked aloud. "Come!"
she cried, dragging Margaret towards the
house. "Come in this moment! It is the
Voice! The Voice of Fernley. I will not stay
here; I will not go in alone. Come with me,
Margaret!"</p>

<p>She was trembling from head to foot, and
even Margaret, who was not timid about such
matters, felt slightly disturbed. Was this
some trick of the children? She must go and
hunt them up, naughty little things. Ah!
What was that, moving in the dusk? It was
almost entirely dark now, but something was
certainly coming up the gravel walk, something
that glimmered white against the black
box-hedges. Miss Sophronia uttered another
piercing shriek, and would have fled, but
Margaret detained her. "Who is that?" said
the girl. "Basil, is that you? Where are the
other children?"</p>

<p>The white figure advanced; it was tall and
slender, and seemed to have no head. Miss
Sophronia moaned, and cowered down at
Margaret's side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"I beg pardon!" said a deep, cheerful
voice. "I hope nothing is wrong. It is only
I, Miss Montfort,&mdash;Gerald Merryweather."</p>

<p>Only a tall youth in white flannels; yet, at
that moment, no one, save Uncle John himself,
could have been more welcome, Margaret
thought. "Oh, Mr. Merryweather," she said,
"I am so glad to see you! No, nothing is
wrong, I hope; that is&mdash;won't you come up
on the verandah? My cousin&mdash;Cousin Sophronia,
let me present Mr. Merryweather."</p>

<p>Mr. Merryweather advanced, bowing politely
to the darkness; when, to his amazement, the
person to whom he was to pay his respects
sprang forward, and clutched him violently.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;you abominable young man!"
cried Miss Sophronia, shrilly. "You made
that noise; you know you made it, to
annoy me! Don't tell me you did not! Get
away from here this instant, you&mdash;you&mdash;impostor!"</p>

<p>Margaret was struck dumb for an instant,
and before she could speak, Gerald Merryweather
was replying, quietly, as if he had
been throttled every day of his life:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"If choking is your object, madam, you can
do it better by pulling the other way, I would
suggest. By pulling in this direction, you see,
you only injure the textile fabric, and leave
the <i>corpus delicti</i> comparatively unharmed."</p>

<p>He stood perfectly still; Miss Sophronia
still clutched and shook him, muttering inarticulately;
but now Margaret seized and
dragged her off by main force. "Cousin
Sophronia!" she cried. "How can you&mdash;what
can you be thinking of? This is Mr.
Merryweather, I tell you, the son of Uncle
John's old schoolmate. Uncle John asked
him to call. I am sure you are not well, or
have made some singular mistake."</p>

<p>"I don't believe a word of it!" said Miss
Sophronia. "Not one single word! What was
he making that noise for, I should like to
know?"</p>

<p>Mr. Merryweather answered with a calm
which he was far from feeling. His pet necktie
was probably ruined, his collar crumpled,
very likely his coat torn. He had taken pains
with his toilet, and now he had been set upon
and harried, by some one he had never seen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
but whom he felt sure to be the Gorgon who
had glared at him out the window several
days before. This was a horrid old lady; he
saw no reason why he should be attacked in
the night by horrid old ladies, when he was
behaving beautifully.</p>

<p>"I am sorry!" he said, rather stiffly. "I
was not conscious of speaking loud. Miss
Montfort asked who it was, and I told her.
If I have offended <i>her</i>, I am ready to apologise&mdash;and
withdraw."</p>

<p>This sounded theatrical, it occurred to him;
but then, the whole scene was fit for the
variety stage. Poor Margaret felt a moment
of despair. What should she do?</p>

<p>"Mr. Merryweather," she said, aloud, "Miss
Montfort has been much startled. Just before
you came, we heard a noise; rather a strange
noise, which we could not account for. I think
her nerves are somewhat shaken. She will be
better in a moment. And&mdash;and I was just
going to the summer-house, to call the children.
Would you come with me, I wonder?"</p>

<p>Miss Sophronia clamoured that she could not
be left alone, but for once Margaret was deaf<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
to her appeals. She was too angry; her guest&mdash;that
is, her uncle's guest&mdash;to be set upon
and shaken, as if he were a naughty child
caught stealing apples,&mdash;it was too shameful!
He would think they were all out of their
senses.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so sorry! So sorry!" she found
herself saying aloud. "Mr. Merryweather, I
am so mortified, so ashamed! What can I say
to you?"</p>

<p>"Say!" said Gerald, his stiffness gone in an
instant. "Don't say anything, Miss Montfort.
I&mdash;I don't mean that; I mean, there's nothing
<i>to</i> say, don't you know? Why, it wasn't
your fault! Who ever thought of its being
your fault?"</p>

<p>"I ought to have recognised you sooner!"
said Margaret. "It was pretty dark, and we
had really been startled, and my cousin is very
nervous. If you would <i>please</i> overlook it this
time I should be so grateful!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>say!</i>" cried the young man. "Miss
Montfort, if you go on in this way, I shall go
back and ask the old&mdash;and ask the lady to
choke me some more. I&mdash;I <i>like</i> being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
choked! I like anything; only don't go on
so! Why, it isn't any matter in the world.
Perhaps it relieved her feelings a bit; and it
didn't do me any harm." He felt of his necktie,
and settled his collar as well as he could,
thankful for the friendly darkness. "Indeed,
I am all right!" he assured her, earnestly.
"Trivets aren't a circumstance to me, as far
as rightness is concerned. Now if you'll
forget all about it, Miss Montfort, please, I
shall be as happy as the bounding roe,&mdash;or
the circumflittergating cockchafer!" he added,
as a large June-bug buzzed past him.</p>

<p>"You are very good!" murmured Margaret.
"I am sure&mdash;but here is the summer-house.
Children, are you here? Basil! Susan D.!"</p>

<p>No answer came. The frogs chirped peacefully,
the brook at the foot of the garden sent
up its soft, bubbling murmur; there was no
other sound. It was very dark, for the trees
were thick overhead. The fireflies flitted
hither and thither, gleaming amid the thickets
of honeysuckle and lilac; the young
man's figure beside her glimmered faintly
in the darkness, but there was no glimpse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
of Susan D.'s white frock, or Basil's white
head.</p>

<p>"Children!" cried Margaret again. "Don't
play any tricks, dears! It is bedtime, and after,
and you must come in. Susan, Cousin wants
you, dear!"</p>

<p>Silence; not a rustle, not a whisper.</p>

<p>"I should suppose they had gone," said
Gerald. "Or do you think they are playing
hookey? Wait a minute, and I'll hunt
around."</p>

<p>But search availed nothing; the children
were not in the summer-house, nor near it.
"They must have gone back to the house,"
said Margaret. "Thank you so much, Mr.
Merryweather. I am sorry to have given you
all this trouble for nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh, trouble!" said Gerald. "This isn't
my idea of trouble, Miss Montfort. What
a pretty place this is! Awfully&mdash;I mean,
extremely pretty."</p>

<p>"It is pretty in the daytime. I should
hardly think you could see anything now, it
is so dark."</p>

<p>"Well, yes, it is dark; but I mean it seems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
such a pleasant place to sit and rest in a little.
Hadn't you better sit and rest a minute, Miss
Montfort? The children are all right, you
may be sure. Gone to bed, most likely, like
good little kids. I&mdash;I often went to bed,
when I was a kid."</p>

<p>Margaret could not help laughing; nevertheless,
she turned decidedly towards the
house. "I am afraid I cannot be sure of
their having gone to bed," she said. "I think
I must find them, Mr. Merryweather, but if
you are tired, you shall rest on the verandah
while I hunt."</p>

<p>Gerald did not want to rest on the verandah,
particularly if his recent assailant were
still there. He wanted to stay here in the garden.
He liked the fireflies, and the frogs; the
murmur of the brook, and the soft voice speaking
out of the darkness. He thought this was
a very nice girl; he wished she would not be
so uneasy about those tiresome youngsters.
However, as there seemed to be no help for
it, he followed Margaret in silence up the
gravel walk. She need not hurry so, he
thought; it was very early, not half past<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
eight yet. He wanted to make his call; he
couldn't dress up like this every night; and,
besides, it was a question whether he could
ever wear this shirt again by daylight.</p>

<p>Miss Sophronia was not on the verandah.</p>

<p>"Will you not come in?" asked Margaret
at the door; but Gerald felt, rather than
heard, the uneasiness in her voice, and decided,
much against his inclination, that it
would be better manners to say good night
and take himself off.</p>

<p>"I think I must be going," he had begun
already, when, from the open door behind
them, burst a long, low, melancholy wail.
The girl started violently. The young man
bent his ear in swift attention. The voice&mdash;the
cry&mdash;trembled on the air, swelled to a
shriek; then died slowly away into a dreary
whisper, and was gone.</p>

<p>Before either of the young people could
speak, the library door was flung open, and
a wild figure came flying out. Miss Sophronia
threw herself once more upon Gerald, and
clung to him with the energy of desperation.
"My dear young man!" cried the distracted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
lady. "Save me! Protect me! I knew your
father! I was at school with your mother,&mdash;Miranda
Cheerley. Save me,&mdash;hold me! Do
not desert me! You are my only hope!"</p>

<p>It was past nine o'clock when Gerald Merryweather
finally took his departure. The
children had been discovered,&mdash;in bed, and
apparently asleep. Three neatly folded piles
of clothes showed at least that they had gone
to bed in a proper and reasonable manner.
Miss Sophronia Montfort had finally been
quieted, by soothing words and promises,
followed up by hot malted milk and checkerberry
cordial, the latter grimly administered
by Frances, and so strong that it made the
poor lady sneeze. Margaret was to sleep with
her; Gerald was to come the next morning to
see how she was; meanwhile, Frances and
Elizabeth, the latter badly frightened, the
former entirely cool and self-possessed, were
to sleep in the front chamber, and be at hand
in case of any untoward event.</p>

<p>There was nothing further to be done save
to shake hands warmly with Margaret, submit
to an embrace from Miss Sophronia, and go.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Mr. Merryweather strode slowly down the
garden path, looking back now and then at
the house, where already the lights on the
lower floor were being extinguished one by
one.</p>

<p>"That's a very nice girl!" he murmured.
"Hildegarde would approve of that girl, I
know. But on the other hand, my son, that
is a horrid old lady. I should like&mdash;Jerry,
my blessed infant, I <i>should</i> like&mdash;to make
that old lady run!" He turned for a final
glance at the house; considered the advisability
of turning a handspring; remembered
his white flannels, and, with a bow to the
corner window, was gone in the darkness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>WHO DID IT?</h3>


<p>"Frightened, was she?" said Mrs. Peyton.
"How sad! Margaret, you are not looking at
my bed-spread. This is the first day I have
used it, and I put it on expressly for you.
What is the use of my having pretty things,
if no one will look at them?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, it is very beautiful!" said Margaret.
"Everything you have is beautiful,
Mrs. Peyton."</p>

<p>"It is Honiton!" said Mrs. Peyton. "It
ought to be handsome. But you do not care,
Margaret, it is perfectly easy to see that. You
don't care about any of my things any more.
I was simply a new toy to you in the beginning,
and you liked to look at me because I
was pretty. Now you have new toys,&mdash;Sophronia
Montfort, I suppose, and a sweet plaything
she is! and you pay no further attention
to me. Deny it if you can!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Margaret did not attempt to deny it; she
was too absolutely truthful not to feel a
certain grain of fact in the lady's accusation.
Life was opening fuller and broader upon her
every day; how could she think of lace bed-spreads,
with three children constantly in her
mind, to think and plan and puzzle for? To
say nothing of Uncle John and all the rest.
And as to the "new toy" aspect, Margaret
knew that she might well enough turn the
accusation upon her lovely friend herself; but
this she was too kind and too compassionate
to do. Would not any one want toys, perhaps,
if forced to spend one's life between four
walls?</p>

<p>So she simply stroked the exquisite hand
that lay like a piece of carved ivory on the
splendid coverlet, and smiled, and waited for
the next remark.</p>

<p>"I knew you would not deny it!" the lady
said. "You couldn't, you see. Well, it doesn't
matter! I shall be dead some day, I hope and
trust. So Sophronia was frightened? Tell me
more about it!"</p>

<p>"She was very much frightened!" said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Margaret. "Mrs. Peyton, I wanted to ask
you&mdash;when the children came home yesterday,
they said something about your having
told them some story of old times here; of a
ghost, or some such thing. I never heard of
anything of the sort. Do you&mdash;do you remember
what it was? I ought not to torment
you!" she added, remorsefully; for Mrs.
Peyton put her hand to her head, and her
brow contracted slightly, as if with pain.</p>

<p>"Only my head, dear, it is rather troublesome
to-day; I suppose I ought not to talk very
much! Yes, there was a ghost, or something
like one, in old times, when I was a child. I
wasn't at Fernley at the time, but I heard
about it; Sophronia was there, and I remember
she was frightened into fits, just as you
describe her last night."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;do you remember anything about
it? It isn't that old story of Hugo Montfort,
is it, the man who looks for papers?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, nothing so interesting as that! I
always longed to see Hugo. No, this is just a
voice that comes and goes, wails about the
rooms and the gardens. It is one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Montfort women, I believe, the one who cut
up her wedding-gown and then went mad."</p>

<p>"Penelope?"</p>

<p>"That's it! Penelope Montfort. Once in
a while they see her, but very rarely, I believe."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Peyton, you are making fun of me.
Aunt Faith told me there was no ghost except
that of Hugo Montfort; of course I don't mean
that there is really that; but no ghost that
people had ever fancied."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, my dear, all this was before
Mrs. Cheriton came to Fernley! Before such
a piece of perfection as she was, no wandering
ghost would have ventured to appear. Now
don't stiffen into stone, Margaret Montfort! I
know she was a saint, but she never liked me,
and I am not a saint, you see. I was always
a sinner, and I expect to remain one. And
certainly, there was a white figure seen about
Fernley, at that time I was speaking of; and
no one ever found out what it was; and if you
want to know any more, you must ask John
Montfort. There, now my head is confused,
and I shall not have a straight thought again
to-day!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>The lady turned her head fretfully on the
pillow. Margaret, who knew her ways well,
sat silent for some minutes, and then began to
sing softly:</p>

<div class='poem'>
O sweetest lady ever seen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(With a heigh ho! and a lily gay,)</span><br />
Give consent to be my queen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(As the primrose spreads so sweetly.)</span><br />
</div>

<p>Before the long ballad was ended, the line
between Mrs. Peyton's eyebrows was gone,
and her beautiful face wore a look of contentment
that was not common to it.</p>

<p>"Go away now!" the lady murmured.
"You have straightened me out again. Be
thankful for that little silver voice of yours,
child! You can do more good with it in the
world than you know. I really think you are
one of the few good persons who are not
odious. Go now! Good-bye!"</p>

<p>Margaret went away, thinking, as she had
often thought before, how like her Cousin Rita
this fair lady was. "Only Rita has a great,
great deal more heart!" she said to herself.
"Rita only laughs at people when she is in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
one of her bad moods. Dear Rita! I wonder
where she is to-day. And Peggy is driving
the mowing machine, she writes; mowing
hundreds of acres, and riding bareback, and
having a glorious time."</p>

<p>A letter had come the day before from
Peggy Montfort, telling of all her delightful
doings on the farm, and begging that her
darling Margaret would come out and spend
the rest of the summer with her. "Darling
Margaret, do, do, <i>do</i> come! Nobody can possibly
want you as much as I do; nobody can
begin to think of wanting you one hundredth
part as much as your own Peggy."</p>

<p>Margaret had laughed over the letter, and
kissed it, and perhaps there was a tear in her
eye when she put it away to answer. It was
good, good to be loved. And Peggy did love
her, and so she hoped&mdash;she knew&mdash;did
Uncle John; and now the children were
hers, two of them, at least; hers to have
and to hold, so far as love went. Go away
and leave them now, when they needed her
every hour? "No, Peggy dear, not even to
see your sweet, round, honest face again."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Coming back to the house she found Gerald
Merryweather on the verandah. He was in
his working clothes again, but they were
fresh and spotless, and he was a pleasant
object to look upon. He explained that he
had called to inquire for the ladies' health,
and to express his hope that they had suffered
no further annoyance the night before. He
was on his way to the bog, and just thought
he would ask if there was anything he could
do.</p>

<p>"Thank you!" said Margaret, gratefully.
"You are very good, Mr. Merryweather. No;
nothing more happened; and my poor cousin
got some sleep after awhile. But I still cannot
imagine what the noise was, can you?"</p>

<p>"So many noises at night, don't you
know?" said Gerald. "Especially round
an old house like this. You were not personally
alarmed, were you, Miss Montfort?
I think you may be pretty sure that there
was nothing supernatural about it. Oh, I
don't mean anything in particular, of course;
but&mdash;well, I never saw a ghost; and I don't
believe in 'em. Do you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly not. I didn't suppose any one
believed in them nowadays. But,&mdash;do you
know, I really am almost afraid my Cousin
Sophronia does. She will not listen to any
explanation I can suggest. I really&mdash;oh,
here she is, Mr. Merryweather!"</p>

<p>Miss Sophronia greeted Gerald with effusion.
"I heard your voice, my dear young
man," she said, "and I came down to beg
that you would take tea with us this evening&mdash;with
my niece&mdash;she is quite the same as
my own niece; I make no difference, dearest
Margaret, I assure you,&mdash;with my niece and
me. If&mdash;if there should be any more unpleasant
occurrences, it would be a comfort
to have a man, however young, on the premises.
Willis sleeps in the barn, and he is
deaf, and would be of little use. He couldn't
even be of the smallest use, if we should be
murdered in our beds."</p>

<p>"Oh, but we are not going to be murdered,
Cousin Sophronia," said Margaret, lightly.
"We are going to be very courageous, and
just let that noise understand that we care
nothing whatever about it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"Margaret, my love, you are trivial," responded
Miss Sophronia, peevishly. "I wish
you would pay attention when I speak. I
ask Mr. Merryweather to take tea with us,
and you talk about noises. Very singular, I
am sure."</p>

<p>"Oh, but of course it would be very
pleasant, indeed, to have Mr. Merryweather
take tea with us!" cried Margaret, in some
confusion. "I hope you will come, Mr.
Merryweather."</p>

<p>It appeared that nothing in the habitable
universe would give Mr. Merryweather greater
pleasure. At half-past six? He would not
fail to be on hand; and if there should be
noises again, why&mdash;let those who made them
look to themselves. And, with this, the
young man took his leave.</p>

<p>The children were very troublesome that
day. Margaret could not seem to lay her
hand on any one of them. If she called
Basil, he was "in the barn, Cousin Margaret,
helping Willis with the hay. Of course I'll
come, if you want me, but Willis seems to
need me a good deal, if you don't mind."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>When it was time for Susan D.'s sewing,
the child came most obediently and affectionately;
but her thimble was nowhere to be
found, and she had mislaid her spool, and,
finally, when everything was found, she had
not sat still ten minutes, when she was "<i>so</i>
thirsty; and must go and get a glass of
water, please, Cousin Margaret!"</p>

<p>"Susan," said Margaret, "I want to talk
to you, and I cannot seem to get a chance for
a word. Sit still now, like a good little girl,
and tell me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Cousin Margaret, I couldn't find my
thimble first, you see; and then there wasn't
any spool, and I left it in my basket yesterday,
I'm sure I did, but Merton <i>will</i> take it to
teach the kitten tricks with, and then it gets
all dirty. Don't you know how horrid a
spool is when a kitten has been playing with
it? You have to wind off yards and yards,
and then the rest is sort of fruzzly, and keeps
making knots."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. Susan D., what were you
doing last evening?" said Margaret.</p>

<p>"Last evening?" repeated the child. "We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
were in the summer-house, Cousin Margaret.
We were playing Scottish Chiefs, don't you
know? Merton had to play Lord Soulis,
'cause he drew the short straw; but he got
cross, and wouldn't play good a bit."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't play <i>well</i>, or <i>nicely</i>," corrected
Margaret. "But after that, Susan dear?"</p>

<p>"That took a long time," said the child.
It seemed, when she was alone with Margaret,
that she could not talk enough; the little
pent-up nature was finding most delightful
relief and pleasure in unfolding before the
sympathy that was always warm, always
ready.</p>

<p>"You see, when it came to carrying me off
(I was Helen Mar, after I'd been Marion and
was dead), Merton was just horrid. He said
he wouldn't carry me off; he said he wouldn't
have me for a gift, and called me Scratchface,
and all kinds of names. And of course
Lord Soulis wouldn't have talked that way;
so Wallace (of course Basil <i>had</i> to be Wallace
when he drew the long straw, and he never
cheats, though Merton does, whenever he gets
a chance)&mdash;well, and so, Wallace told him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
if he didn't carry me off in two shakes of a
cat's tail&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Susan D.!"</p>

<p>"Well, that's what he <i>said</i>, Cousin Margaret.
I'm telling you just as it happened,
truly I am. If he didn't carry me off in two
shakes of a cat's tail, he'd pitch him over the
parapet,&mdash;you know there's a splendid parapet
in the summer-house,&mdash;and so he wouldn't,
and so he did; but Mert held on, and they
both went over into the meadow. I guess
Lord Soulis got the worst of it down there,
for when they climbed up again he did carry
me off, though he pinched me hard all the way,
and made my arm all black and blue; I didn't
say anything, because I was Helen Mar, but I
gave it to him good&mdash;I mean well&mdash;this
morning, and served him out. And then
Wallace had to rescue me, of course, and that
was <i>great</i>, and we all fell over the parapet
again, and that was the way I tore the gathers
out of my frock. So you see, Cousin
Margaret!"</p>

<p>Susan D. paused for breath, and bent over
her sewing with exemplary diligence. Mar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>garet
took the child's chin in her hand, and
raised her face towards her.</p>

<p>"Susan," she said, gently, "after you had
that fine play&mdash;it must have been a great
play, and I wish I had seen it&mdash;after that,
what did you do?"</p>

<p>"We&mdash;we&mdash;went to bed!" said Susan D.</p>

<p>"Why did you go without coming to
say good night? Answer me truly, dear
child."</p>

<p>The two pairs of gray eyes looked straight
into each other. A shadow of fear&mdash;a suggestion
of the old look of distrust and suspicion&mdash;crept
into the child's eyes for a
moment; but before Margaret's kind, firm,
loving gaze it vanished and was gone. A
wave of colour swept over her face; her eyes
wavered, gave one imploring glance, and
fell.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to tell me, Susan D.?"
asked Margaret once more.</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no!" said Susan D., in a whisper
scarcely audible.</p>

<p>"No? And why not, dear child?"</p>

<p>"I promised!" whispered Susan D.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>"Susan D., do you know anything about
that strange noise that frightened us so last
night?"</p>

<p>But not another word would Susan D. say.
She looked loving, imploring, deprecating;
she threw her arms around Margaret's neck,
and hid her face and clung to her; but no
word could she be brought to say. At last
Margaret, displeased and puzzled, felt constrained
to tell the child rather sternly to fold
her work and go away, and not come back to
her till she could answer questions properly.
Susan went obediently; at the door she hesitated,
and Margaret heard a little sigh, which
made her heart go out in sympathy toward
the little creature. Instantly she rose, and,
going to the child, put her arms round her
affectionately.</p>

<p>"Darling, I think you are puzzled about
something," she said, quickly. Susan D. nodded,
and clung close to her cousin's side.</p>

<p>"I will not ask you anything more," said
Margaret. "I am going to trust you, Susan
D., not to do anything wrong. Remember,
dear, that the two most important things in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the world are truth and kindness. Now kiss
me, dear, and go."</p>

<p>Left alone, Margaret sat for some time,
puzzling over what had happened, and wondering
what would happen next. It was evident
that the children were concerned in some
way, or at least had some knowledge, of the
mysterious sounds which had so alarmed
Miss Sophronia. What ought she to do?
How far must she try to force confession from
them, if it were her duty to try; and how
could she do it?</p>

<p>Thus pondering, she became aware of voices
in the air; she sat near the open window, and
the voices were from above her. The nursery
window! She listened, bending nearer,
and holding her breath.</p>

<p>"Well, if you back out now, Susan D., it
will be mean!" Basil was saying. "What
did you say to her?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say anything!" Susan D. answered,
sullenly.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell her that we had a
pain, and didn't want to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'both&eacute;r'">bother</ins> her, 'cause
she had company?" cried Merton, eagerly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
"I had that all fixed to tell her, only she
never asked me."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't tell her a lie," said Susan D.
"Basil, you wouldn't tell her a lie, either,
you know you wouldn't, when she looks at
you that way, straight at you, and you can't
get your eyes away."</p>

<p>"Of course I wouldn't," said Basil. "And
the reason she didn't ask you, Merton, was
because she knew it wouldn't make much difference
what you said. That's the trouble
about you. But now, Susan, if you had only
had a little dipplo-macy, you could have got
through all right, as I did."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean by dipplo-macy,"
retorted Susan.</p>

<p>"Ho, stupid!" sneered Merton.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you know what it means
yourself!" cried Basil. "Come, tell now, if
you are so wise. What does it mean? Ah,
I knew you didn't know! You <i>are</i> a sneak,
Mert! Well, I guess in the beginning, when
Adam was making the words, you know, he
must have wanted to hide from the serpent or
something&mdash;perhaps a hairy mammoth, or a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
megatherium, I shouldn't wonder,&mdash;so he
said, 'Dip low,' and then 'Massy!' for a
kind of exclamation, you see. And spelling
gets changed a lot in the course of time; you
can see that just from one class to another in
the grammar school. Well, anyhow, it means
a sort of getting round things, managing
them, without telling lies, or truth either."</p>

<p>"You've got to tell one or the other,"
objected Susan D.</p>

<p>"No, you haven't, either! Now, how did I
manage? I have just kept out of Cousin
Margaret's way all day, so far, and I'm going
to keep out the rest of it. I've been helping
Willis ever since breakfast, and he says I
really helped him a great deal, and I'll make
a farmer yet; only I won't, 'cause I'm going
into the navy. And now pretty soon I'm
going in, in a tearing hurry, and ask her if I
can take some lunch and go over to see Mr.
Merryweather at the bog, 'cause he is going to
give me a lesson in surveying. He <i>is;</i> he said
he would, any time I came over. And so,
you see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all very well," interrupted Merton,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
scornfully. "But when it comes night, what'll
you do then, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"Easy enough. I shall have a headache,
and she won't ask me questions when I have
a headache; she'll just sit and stroke my
head, and put me to sleep."</p>

<p>"Ho! How'll you get your headache? Have
to tell a lie then, I guess."</p>

<p>"No, sir, I won't! And if you say that
again, I'll bunt you up against the wall. Easy
enough to get a headache. I don't know
whether I shall eat hot doughnuts, or just
ram my head against the horse-chestnut-tree
till it aches; but I'll get the headache, you
may bet your boots&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Basil, she asked you not to say that, and
you said you wouldn't."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sorry; I didn't mean to. Pull
out a hair, Susan D., and then I shall remember
next time. Ouch! You pulled out two."</p>

<p>"I say, come on!" cried Merton. "We've
got lots of things to see to. We have to&mdash;"</p>

<p>The voices were gone. Margaret sat still,
sewing steadily, and working many thoughts
into her seam.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>It might have been half an hour after this
that Basil burst into the room, breathless and
beaming, his tow-colored hair standing on end.
"Oh, Cousin Margaret, can I&mdash;I mean may
I, go over to the bog? Mr. Merryweather said
he would give me a lesson in surveying; and
Frances is going to put me up some luncheon,
and I'm in a <i>norful</i> hurry. May I go, please?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Basil; you may go after you have
answered me one question."</p>

<p>"Yes, Cousin Margaret," said the diplomat.
"I may miss Mr. Merryweather if I don't go
pretty quick, but of course I will."</p>

<p>"Basil, did you make that strange noise
last night?"</p>

<p>"No, Cousin Margaret!" cried the boy; the
smile seemed to break from every corner of
his face at once, and his eyes looked straight
truth into hers. "I did not. Is that all?
You said one question! Thank you ever and
ever so much! Good-bye!" And he was gone.</p>

<p>"It is quite evident that I am not a dipplo-mat,"
said Margaret, with a laugh that ended
in a sigh. "I wish Uncle John would come
home!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>BLACK SPIRITS AND WHITE.</h3>


<p>The evening fell close and hot. Gerald
Merryweather, taking his way to Fernley
House, noticed the great white thunder-heads
peering above the eastern horizon. "There'll
be trouble by and by," he said.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I wonder, oh, I wonder,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">If they're afraid of thunder.</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>"Ever lapsing into immortal verse, my son.
You are the Lost Pleiad of Literature, that's
what you are; and a mighty neat phrase that
is. Oh, my Philly, why aren't you here, to
take notice of my coruscations? Full many a
squib is born to blaze unseen, and waste its
fizzing&mdash;Hello, you, sir! Stop a minute, will
you?"</div>

<p>A small boy was scudding along the path
before him. He turned his head, but on see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>ing
Gerald he only doubled his rate of speed.
Merton was a good runner for his size, but it
was ill trying to race the Gambolling Greyhound,
as Gerald had been called at school.
Two or three quick steps, two or three long,
lopping bounds, and Master Merton was
caught, clutched by the collar, and held aloft,
wriggling and protesting.</p>

<p>"You let me go!" whined Merton. "Oh,
please Mr. Merryweather, don't stop me now.
It's very important, indeed, it is."</p>

<p>"Just what I was thinking," said Gerald.
"We'll go along together, my son. I wouldn't
squirm, if I were you; destructive to the
collar; believe one who has suffered. What!
it is not so many years. Take courage, small
cat, and strive no more!"</p>

<p>Merton, after one heroic wriggle, gave up
the battle, and walked beside his captor in
sullen silence.</p>

<p>"Come!" said Gerald. "Let us be merry,
my son. As to that noise, now!"</p>

<p>"What noise?" asked Merton, peevishly.</p>

<p>"The roarer, my charmer. Why beat about
the bush? You frightened the old&mdash;that is,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
you alarmed both your cousins, with the joyful
instrument known among the profane as a
roarer. Tush! Why attempt concealment?
Have I not roared, when time was? And a
very pretty amusement, I could never deny;
but I wouldn't try it again, that's all. You
hear, young sir? I wouldn't try it again."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean&mdash;" Merton
began; but at this Gerald lifted him gently
from the ground by his shirt-collar, and, waving
him about, intimated gently that it would
not be good for his health to tell lies.</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't do it, anyhow!" Merton
protested. "Honest, I did not."</p>

<p>"Honesty is not written in your expressive
countenance, Master Merton Montfort," said
Gerald. "However, it may be so. We shall
see. Meantime, young fellow, and merely as
between man and man, you understand, it
would be money in your youthful pocket if
you could acquire the habit of looking a
person in the eyes, and not directing that
cherubic gaze at the waistcoat buttons, or
even the necktie, of your in-ter-loc-utor.
Now, here we are at the house, and you may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
go, my interesting popinjay. Bear in mind
that my eye is upon you. Adieu! adieu!
Rrrrrememberrrr me!!!"</p>

<p>Gerald put such dramatic fervour into this
farewell that Merton was as heartily frightened
as he could have desired, and scurried
away without stopping to look behind.</p>

<p>"That's not such a very nice little boy, I
believe," said Gerald. "T'other one is worth
a cool dozen of Master Merton. Well, they
won't do much mischief while I am to the
fore. Though I should be loth to interfere
with the end they probably have in view. I
should like full well myself to make that&mdash; Ah,
good evening, Miss Montfort!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was so hot after tea, that even Miss
Sophronia made no suggestion of sitting in
the house. They all assembled on the
verandah, which faced south, so that generally
here, if anywhere, a breath of evening
coolness might be had. To-night, however,
no such breath was to be felt. The thunder-heads
had crept up, up, half-way across the
sky; their snowy white had changed to black<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>ish
blue; and now and again, there opened
here or there what looked like a deep cavern,
filled with lurid flame; and then would follow
a long, rolling murmur, dying away into faint
mutterings and losing itself among the treetops.</p>

<p>Miss Sophronia was very uneasy. At one
moment she declared she must go into the
house, she could not endure this; the next
she vowed she would rather see the danger as
it came, and she would never desert the
others, never.</p>

<p>"Do you think there is danger, my dear
young man?" she asked, for perhaps the tenth
time.</p>

<p>"Why, no!" said Gerald. "No more than
usual, Miss Montfort. These trees, you see,
are a great protection. If the lightning
strikes one of them, of course it will divert
the fluid from the house. If you have no
iron about your person&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here Miss Sophronia interrupted him.
She begged to be excused for a moment, and
went into the house. When she returned,
her head was enveloped in what looked like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
a "tidy" of purple wool, while her feet were
shuffling along in a pair of blue knitted
slippers.</p>

<p>"There!" she said, "I have removed every
atom of metal, my dear young man, down to
my hairpins, I assure you; and there were
nails in my shoes, Margaret. My dear, I
advise you to follow my example. So important,
I always say, to obey the dictates of
science. I shall always consider it a special
providence that sent this dear young man
to us at this trying time. Go at once,
dearest Margaret, I implore you."</p>

<p>But Margaret refused to adopt any such
measures of precaution. She was enjoying
the slow oncoming of the storm; she had
seldom seen anything more beautiful, she
thought, and Gerald agreed with her. He
was sitting near her, and had taken Merton
on his knee, to that young gentleman's manifest
discomposure. He wriggled now and
then, and muttered some excuse for getting
down, but Gerald blandly assured him each
time that he was not inconveniencing him in
the least, and begged him to make himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
comfortable, and entirely at home. Meantime,
Margaret had called Basil and Susan
D. to her side, and was holding a hand of
each, calling upon them from time to time
to see the wonderful beauty of the approaching
storm. They responded readily enough,
and were really interested and impressed.
Once or twice, it is true, Basil stole a glance
at his sister, and generally found her looking
at him in a puzzled, inquiring fashion; then
he would shake his head slightly, and give
himself up once more to watching the sky.</p>

<p>It was a very extraordinary sky. The
clouds, now deep purple, covered it almost
from east to west; only low down in the
west a band of angry orange still lingered,
and added to the sinister beauty of the scene.
The red caverns opened deeper and brighter,
and now and again a long, zigzag flash of gold
stood out for an instant against the black,
and following it came crack upon crack of
thunder, rolling and rumbling over their
heads. But still the air hung close and
heavy, still there was no breath of wind, no
drop of rain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>Sitting thus, and for the moment silent,
there came, in a pause of the thunder, a
new sound; a sound that some of them, at
least, knew well. Close at hand, rising apparently
from the very wall at their side,
came the long, eerie wail of the night before.
Louder and louder it swelled, till it
rang like a shriek in their ears, then suddenly
it broke and shuddered itself away, till only
the ghost of a sound crept from their ears,
and was lost. Margaret and Gerald both
sprang to their feet, the girl held the children's
hands fast in hers, the lad clutched the
boy in his arms till he whimpered and cried;
their eyes met, full of inquiry, the same
thought flashing from blue eyes and gray.
Not the children? What, then? Before
Gerald could speak, Miss Sophronia was
clinging to him again, shrieking and crying;
calling upon him to save her; but this
time Gerald put her aside with little ceremony.</p>

<p>"If you'll take this boy!" he cried.
"Hold him tight, please, and don't let him
get off. I'm going&mdash;if I may?" he looked
swift inquiry at Margaret.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes!" cried the girl. "Do go!
We are all right. Cousin Sophronia, you
<i>must</i> let him go."</p>

<p>Dropping Merton into the affrighted lady's
arms, the lithe, active youth was in the house
in an instant, following the Voice of Fernley.
There it came again, rising, rising,&mdash;the cry
of a lost soul, the wail of a repentant spirit.</p>

<p>"A roarer, by all means!" said young Merryweather.
"But where, and by whom?"
He ran from side to side, laying his ear
against the wall here, there, following the
sound. Suddenly he stopped short, like a
dog pointing. Here, in this thickness of the
wall, was it? Then, there must be a recess,
a something. What corresponded to this
jog? Ha! that little low door, almost hidden
by the great picture of the boar-hunt.
Locked? No; only sticking, from not having
been opened, perhaps, for years. It yielded.
He rushed in,&mdash;the door closed behind him
with a spring. He found himself in total
darkness,&mdash;darkness filled with a hideous
cry, that rang out sharp and piercing,&mdash;then
fell into sudden silence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it you, Master Merton?" said a whisper.
"I didn't wait; I thought maybe&mdash;"</p>

<p>Gerald stretched out his arm, and grasped
a solid form. Instantly he was grasped in
return by a pair of strong arms,&mdash;grasped
and held with as powerful a grip as his
own. A full minute passed, two creatures
clutching each other in the pit-dark, listening
to each other's breathing, counting each
other's heart-beats. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Gerald, under his
breath.</p>

<p>"None of your business!" was the reply,
low, but prompt. "Who are you, if it comes
to that?"</p>

<p>"Why,&mdash;why, you're a woman!"</p>

<p>"And you're a man, and that's worse.
What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"I am taking tea here. I'm a visitor. I
have been here all the evening."</p>

<p>"And I've been here twenty years. I'm
the cook."</p>

<p>The young man loosed his hold, and
dropped on the floor. He rocked back
and forth, in silent convulsions of laughter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>"The cook! Great C&aelig;sar, the cook! Oh,
dear me! Stop me, somebody. What&mdash;what
did you do it for?" he gasped, between
the paroxysms.</p>

<p>"Hush! Young Mr. Merryweather, is it?
Do be quiet, sir! We're close by the verandah.
Was&mdash;was she frightened, sir?"</p>

<p>"She? Who? One of 'em was."</p>

<p>"She&mdash;the old one. I wouldn't frighten
Miss Margaret; but she has too much sense.
Was the other one scared, sir?"</p>

<p>"Into fits, very near. You did it well,
Mrs. Cook! I couldn't have done it better,&mdash;look
here! I shall have to tell them,
though. I came expressly to find out&mdash;"</p>

<p>Groping in the dark, Frances clutched his
arm again, this time in a gentler grasp.
"Don't you do it, sir!" she whispered.
"Young gentleman, don't you do it! If
you do, she'll stay here all her days. No
one can't stand her, sir, and this were the
only way. Hark! Save us! What's that?"</p>

<p>No glimmer of light could penetrate to the
closet where they stood, in the thickness of
the wall, but a tremendous peal of thunder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
shook the house, and Miss Sophronia's voice
could be heard calling frantically on Gerald
to come back.</p>

<p>"I must go," said Gerald. "I&mdash;I won't
give you away, Mrs. Cook. Shake!"</p>

<p>"You're a gentleman, sir," replied Frances.
They shook hands in the dark, and
Gerald ran out. Even as he opened the
door the storm broke. A violent blast of
wind, a blinding flare, a rattling volley
of thunder, and down came the rain.</p>

<p>A rush, a roar, the trampling of a thousand
horses; and overhead the great guns
bellowing, and the flashes coming and going&mdash;it
was a wild scene. The family had
come in, and were all standing in the front
hall. All? No, two, only,&mdash;Margaret and
Miss Sophronia. In the confusion and tumult,
the children had escaped, and were
gone. Margaret, a little pale, but perfectly
composed, met Gerald with a smile, as if it
were the most ordinary thing in the world
for young gentlemen to walk out of the wall.
She was supporting Miss Sophronia, who had
quite lost her head, and was crying piteously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
that they would die together, and that whoever
escaped must take her watch and chain
back to William. "Poor William, what will
become of him and those helpless babes?"</p>

<p>"It's all right, Miss Montfort," said Gerald,
cheerfully. "I ran the noise down, and it
was the simplest thing in the world. Nothing
to be alarmed about, I do assure you;
nothing."</p>

<p>"What was it?" asked Margaret, in an
undertone.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you by and by," replied the
young man, in the same tone. "Not now,
please; I promised&mdash;somebody. You shall
know all in good time."</p>

<p>His look of bright confidence was not to be
resisted. Margaret nodded cheerfully, and
submitted to be mystified in her own home
by an almost total stranger. Indeed, the
Voice of Fernley had suddenly sunk into
insignificance beside the Voice of Nature.
The turmoil outside grew more and more
furious. At length a frightful crash announced
that the lightning had struck somewhere
very near the house. This was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
last straw for poor Miss Sophronia. She
fled up-stairs, imploring Gerald and Margaret
to follow her. "Let us die together!" she
cried. "I am responsible for your young
lives; we will pass away in one embrace.
The long closet, Margaret! It is our only
chance of life,&mdash;the long closet!"</p>

<p>The long closet, as it was called, was in
reality a long enclosed passage, leading from
the Blue Room, where Miss Sophronia slept,
to one of the spare chambers beyond. It was
a dim place, lighted only by a transom above
the door. Here were kept various ancient
family relics which would not bear the light
of day; a few rusty pictures, some ancient
hats, and, notably, a bust of some deceased
Montfort, which stood on a shelf, covered
with a white sheet, like a half-length ghost.
Margaret did not think this gloomy place at
all a cheerful place for a nervous woman in
a thunder-storm; so, nodding to Gerald to
follow, she ran up-stairs. But before she
reached the landing, terrific shrieks began to
issue from the upper floor; shrieks so agonising,
so ear-piercing, that they dominated even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the clamour of the storm. Margaret flew, and
Gerald flew after. What new portent was
here? Breathless, Margaret reached the door
of the long closet. It stood open. On the
floor inside crouched Miss Sophronia, uttering
the frantic screams which rang through the
house. Apparently she had lost the use of
her limbs from terror, else she would not
have remained motionless before the figure
which was advancing towards her from the
gloom of the long passage. First a dusky
whiteness glimmered from the black of the
further end, where the half-ghost sat on
its shelf; then gradually the whiteness
detached itself, took shape,&mdash;if it could be
called shape,&mdash;emerged into the dim half-light,&mdash;came
on slowly, silently. Shrouded,
like the ghostly bust behind it, tall and
slender, with dark locks escaping beneath the
hood or cowl that drooped low over its face,&mdash;with
one hand raised, and pointing stiffly
at the unhappy woman,&mdash;the figure came on&mdash;and
on&mdash;till it saw Margaret. Then it
stopped. Next came in view the bright, eager
face of Gerald Merryweather, looking over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Margaret's shoulder. And at that, the spectre
began, very slowly, and with ineffable dignity,
to retreat.</p>

<p>"Exclusive party," whispered Gerald. "Objects
to our society, Miss Montfort. Shall I
head him off, or let him go?"</p>

<p>Margaret made no reply; she was bending
over the poor lady on the floor, trying to
make her hear, trying to check the screams
which still rang out with piercing force.</p>

<span class="caption">A LIVELY GHOST.</span>
</div>

<p>"Cousin Sophronia! Cousin, do stop! Do
listen to me! It is a trick, a naughty, naughty
trick; nothing else in the world. Do, please,
stop screaming, and listen to me. Oh, what
shall I do with her?" This remark was
addressed to Gerald; but that young gentleman
was no longer beside her. He had been
keeping his eye on the spectre, which slowly,
softly glided back and back, until it melted
once more into the thick blackness at the
further end. Gerald dodged out into the hall,
and ran along the outer passage, to meet, as
he expected, the ghost full and fair at the
other door. "Run!" cried a small voice.
"I'll hold him; run!" Gerald was grasped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
once more, this time by a pair of valiant little
hands which did their best, and which he put
aside very gently, seeing a petticoat beneath
them. "You sha'n't catch him!" cried the
second spectre, clinging stoutly to his legs.</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Twice he wrung her hands in twain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But the small hands closed again!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Meantime the spectre-in-chief had darted
back into the closed passage. There was a
crash. The half-ghost toppled over as he
ran against it, and was shivered on the floor,
adding another noise to the confusion. The
phantom raced along the passage, took a flying
leap over Miss Sophronia's prostrate form,
revealing, had any looked, an unsuspected
blackness of leg beneath the flowing white,
and scudded along the square upper hall. By
this time Gerald was at his heels again, and a
pretty race it was. Round the hall, up the
stairs, and round the landing of the attic flight.
At the attic door the spectre wavered an
instant,&mdash;then turned, and dashed down-stairs
again. Once more round the upper hall, now
down the great front staircase, gathering his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
skirts as he went, the black legs now in
good evidence, and making wonderful play. A
good runner, surely. But the Greyhound was
gaining; he was upon him. The phantom gave
a wild shriek, gained the front door with one
desperate leap, and plunged, followed by his
pursuer, into the arms of a gentleman who
stood in the doorway, in the act of entering.</p>

<p>"Easy, there!" said Mr. Montfort, receiving
pursuer and pursued with impartial calm. "Is
it the Day of Judgment, or what?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>A DEPARTURE.</h3>


<p>"I am extremely sorry, Sophronia, that you
were so alarmed last night. I trust you feel
no ill effects this morning?"</p>

<p>"Ill effects! My dear John, I am a wreck!
Simply a wreck, mentally and physically. I
shall never recover from it&mdash;never."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say that, Cousin Sophronia!"
exclaimed Margaret, who was really much distressed
at all that passed.</p>

<p>"My love, if it is the truth, I must say
it. Truth, Margaret, is what I live for. No,
I shall never recover, I feel it. My prayer is
that these unhappy children may never know
that they are the cause of my untimely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Has Basil made his apology?" asked Mr.
Montfort, abruptly.</p>

<p>"Yes, John, yes; I am bound to say he
has, though he showed little feeling in it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Not a tenth part so much as little Merton,
who was in real sorrow,&mdash;actually shed tears,&mdash;although
he had no hand in the cruel deceit.
Ah! Merton is the only one of those
children who has any heart."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" said Mr. Montfort, "I didn't
know it was as bad as that."</p>

<p>"Quite, I assure you, dearest John. If it
were not for my poor William and his children,
I should take Merton with me and be a
mother to him. His nerves, like mine, are
shattered by the terrible occurrences of the
last two nights. He was positively hysterical
as he pointed out to me&mdash;what I had
already pointed out to you, Margaret&mdash;that
the <i>real thing</i> had not been explained. I
might, in time, live down the effect of those
children's wicked jest; but the Voice of Fernley
has never been explained, and never will
be."</p>

<p>Mr. Montfort pulled his moustache, and
looked out of the window, observing the
prospect; but Margaret cried:</p>

<p>"Oh, Cousin Sophronia, you are wrong;
indeed, indeed you are! Young Mr. Merry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>weather
found out all about it last night, only
he had not time to tell us. He said it was
something perfectly simple, and that there
was no need of being alarmed in the least."</p>

<p>"By the way," said Mr. Montfort, "I have
a note from the lad this morning. He found
some special tools were needed, and went up
to town by the early train to see about them.
May be gone a day or two, he says. What
was the noise like, Margaret?"</p>

<p>Margaret was about to tell all she knew,
but Miss Sophronia interrupted. "Spare me,
dearest Margaret, spare me the recalling of
details. I am still too utterly broken,&mdash;I
shall faint, I know I shall. John, it was simply
the voice that was heard ten, or it may
be fifteen years ago, when I was a young girl.
You must remember; it is impossible but
that you must remember."</p>

<p>"I remember perfectly," said Mr. Montfort.
"That was thirty years ago, Sophronia; that
was in 1866. Oh, yes, I remember." Again
Mr. Montfort became absorbed in the view
from the window. His face was very grave;
why, then, did the buttons on his waistcoat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
shake? "And Master Merton was frightened,
was he?" he resumed, presently. "Ha! that
looks bad. Good morning, Jones," as a respectable-looking
man in livery came up the
gravel walk. "A note for me? no answer?
thanks." The man touched his hat, and departed;
Mr. Montfort opened the pretty, pearl-coloured
note, and read, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">Dear John</span>:

<p>"Don't punish the children; it was partly my
fault, and partly your own. I supposed you expected
something to happen, and I thought the old trick
would serve as well as a new one.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">"As ever,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">E. P.</span>"<br />
</div>
</div>

<p>"Humph!" said Mr. Montfort, twisting the
note, and frowning at the window. "Precisely!
and so, you were saying, Sophronia&mdash;ahem!
that is, you are obliged to leave us?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my dearest John, I must go. I could
not, no! I could not sleep another night beneath
this roof. I have told Willis. I am
cut to the heart at leaving you, so helpless,
with only this poor child here, and those&mdash;those
dreadful children of Anthony's. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
would so gladly have made a home for you,
my poor cousin. I live only for others; but
still it seems my duty <i>to</i> live, and I am convinced
that another night here would be my
death."</p>

<p>"I will not attempt to change your purpose,
Sophronia. At the same time I am bound to
tell you that&mdash;a&mdash;that the disturbance of
which you speak is of no supernatural kind,
but is attributable to&mdash;to human agency altogether.
If you wish, I will have it looked
into at once, or we can wait till young Merryweather
comes back. He seemed to know
about it, you say, Margaret. And&mdash;but at
any rate, Sophronia, we can write you the
sequel, and, if you feel uneasy, why, as you
say&mdash; You have ordered Willis? Then I'll
go and get some tags for your trunks."</p>

<p>Mr. Montfort retired with some alacrity,
and Margaret, with an unexplained feeling
of guilt at her heart, offered to help Miss
Sophronia with her packing.</p>

<p>An hour later the lady was making her
adieux. The carriage was at the door, Willis
had strapped on the two trunks, and all was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
ready. Mr. Montfort shook his cousin by the
hand, and was sorry that her visit had ended
in such an untoward manner. Margaret
begged Cousin Sophronia's pardon for anything
she might have done amiss. Indeed, the
girl's heart was full of a vague remorse. She
had tried, but she felt that she might have
tried harder to make things go smoothly.
But Miss Sophronia bore, she declared, no
malice to any one.</p>

<p>"I came, dear John, determined to do my
best, to be a sister to you in every way; it
will always be a comfort to think that I have
been with you these two months. It may be
that some time, when my nerves are restored,
I may be able to come to Fernley again; if
you should make any changes, you understand
me. Indeed, a complete change, my dear
cousin, is the thing I should most recommend.
Missing me as you will,&mdash;a companion of your
own age,&mdash;you might still marry, dearest
John, you might indeed. Emily&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That will do, Sophronia!" said Mr. Montfort,
sternly. "Have you everything you
want for the journey?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>"Everything, I think, dear John. Ah!
well, good-bye, Margaret! It has been a blow
to find that you do not love me, my dear,
as I have loved you, but we must bear our
burdens."</p>

<p>"What do you&mdash;what can you mean,
Cousin Sophronia?" asked Margaret, turning
crimson. "I am sure I have tried&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! well, my dear, one gives oneself
away," said the lady. "You said in your letter
to your cousin,&mdash;I recall the precise words&mdash;'I
have tried to love her, but I cannot
succeed.' Yes; very painful to one who has
a heart like mine; but I find so few&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cousin Sophronia," cried the girl, all softer
thoughts now merged in a burning resentment.
"You&mdash;you read my letter, the letter that
was on my own desk, in my own room?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, my love, I did. I hope I know
something about young girls and their ways;
I considered it my duty, my sacred duty, to
see what you wrote."</p>

<p>"You seem to know little about the ways
of gentle people!" cried Margaret, unable for
once to restrain herself. Her uncle laid his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
hand on her arm. "Steady, little woman!"
he said. His quiet, warning voice brought
the angry girl to herself, the more quickly
that she knew his sympathy was all with her.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I should not have said that, Cousin
Sophronia," she said. "I beg your pardon!
Good-bye!"</p>

<p>She could not say more; she stood still,
with burning cheeks, while Mr. Montfort
helped the lady into the carriage.</p>

<p>"A pleasant journey to you, Sophronia,"
he said, as he closed the door. "Willis&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" cried Miss Sophronia, out of
the window. "Bless you, dearest John! Margaret,
my love, I shall always think of you
most tenderly, believe me, in spite of everything.
It is impossible for me to harbour resentment.
No, my child, I shall always love
you as a sister. I have taken the old vinaigrette
with me, as a little souvenir of you; I
knew it would give you pleasure to have me
use it. Bless you! And, John, if you want
me to look up some good servants for you, I
know of an excellent woman who would be
the very thing&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>"Willis!" said Mr. Montfort again. "You'll
miss that train, Sophronia, if you don't,&mdash;<i>bon
voyage!</i>"</p>

<p>Mr. Montfort stood for some seconds looking
after the carriage as it drove off; then he
drew a long breath, and threw out his arms,
opening his broad chest.</p>

<p>"Ha!" said he. "So that is over. Here
endeth the&mdash; What, crying, May Margaret?
Come and sit here beside me, child; or shall
we come out and see the roses? Really astonishing
to have this number of roses in August;
but some of these late kinds are very fine, I
think."</p>

<p>Chatting quietly and cheerfully, he moved
from one shrub to another, while Margaret
wiped her eyes, and gradually quieted her
troubled spirit.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Uncle John!" she said,
presently. "You know, don't you? You
always know, just as papa did. But&mdash;but
I never heard of any one's doing such a thing,
did you?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you, my dear? Well, you see, you
didn't know your Cousin Sophronia when she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
was a girl. And&mdash;let us be just," he added.
"You, belonging to the new order, have no
idea of what many people thought and did
forty years ago. I have no doubt, from my
recollection of my Aunt Melissa, Sophronia's
mother, that she read all her children's letters.
I know she searched my pockets once, thinking
I had stolen sugar; I hadn't, that time,
and my white rat was in my pocket, and bit
her, and I was glad."</p>

<p>Seeing Margaret laugh again, Mr. Montfort
added, in a different tone, "And now, I must
see those boys."</p>

<p>The children were sent for to the study,
where they remained for some time. Basil
and Susan D. came out looking very grave;
they went up to the nursery in silence, and
sat on the sofa, rubbing their heads together,
and now and then exchanging a murmur of
sympathy and understanding. Merton remained
after the others, and when he emerged
from the fatal door, he was weeping profusely,
and refused to be comforted by Elizabeth;
and was found an hour after, pinching Chico's
tail, and getting bitten in return. Telling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Margaret about it afterward, Mr. Montfort
said:</p>

<p>"Basil and the little girl tell a perfectly
straight story. It is just as I supposed; they
were trying the old ghost trick that we other
boys, your father and Richard and I, Margaret,
played on Sophronia years ago. If the
thunder-storm had not brought you all up-stairs,
there would have been some very pretty
ghost-gliding, and the poor soul would very
likely have been frightened into a real fit instead
of an imaginary one. Children don't
realise that sort of thing; I certainly did not,
nor my brothers; but I think these two realise
it now, and they are not likely to try anything
of the kind again. As for the noise,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle John, I am really much more
puzzled about that noise, for, of course, I saw
the other foolishness with my eyes."</p>

<p>"Well!" said Mr. Montfort, comfortably,
"we used to make that noise with a thing
we called a roarer; I don't know whether
they have such things now. You take a
tomato-can, and put a string through it,
and then you&mdash; It really does make a fine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
noise, very much what you describe. Yes,
I have that on my conscience, too, Margaret.
You see, I told you I knew this kind of child,
and so I do, and for good reason. But Basil
won't say anything at all about the matter.
He says it was not his hunt, and he will tell
all that he did, but cannot tell on others;
which is entirely proper. But when I turned
to that other little scamp, Merton, I could
get nothing but floods of tears, and entreaties
that I would ask Frances. 'Frances knows
all about it!' he said, over and over."</p>

<p>"And have you seen Frances?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no," replied Mr. Montfort, rather
slowly. "I am going to see Frances now."</p>

<p>Accordingly, a few minutes later, Frances,
bustling about her kitchen, became aware of
her master standing in the doorway. She became
aware of him, I say, but it was with
"the tail of her eye" only; she took no
notice of him, and went on rattling dish-pans
at an alarming rate. She appeared to be
house-cleaning; at all events, the usually neat
kitchen was in a state of upheaval, and the
chairs and tables, tubs and clothes-horses,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
were so disposed that it was next to impossible
for any one to enter. Moreover, Frances
apparently had a toothache, for her face was
tied up in a fiery red handkerchief; and
when Mr. Montfort saw that handkerchief, he
looked grave, and hung about the door more
like a schoolboy than a dignified gentleman
and the proprietor of Fernley House.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Frances," he said at
length, in a conciliatory tone.</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir," said Frances; and
plunged her mop into a pail of hot water.</p>

<p>"You have a toothache, Frances? I am
very sorry."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I have; thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"A&mdash;Frances&mdash;I came to ask if you can
tell me anything about the strange noise that
frightened the ladies so, last night and the
night before."</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Frances. "I can't tell
you nothing about it. There do be rats
enough in this house, Mr. Montfort, to make
any kind of a noise; and I do wish, sir, as
the next time you are in town, you would get
me a rat-trap as is good for something.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
There's nothing but trash, as the rats won't
look at, and small blame to them. I can't be
expected to do without things to do with,
Mr. Montfort, and I was saying so to Elizabeth
only this morning."</p>

<p>"I will see to the traps, Frances. But this
noise that I am speaking of; Master Merton
says&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I was wishful to ask you, sir, if you
would please tell Master Merton to keep out
of my kitchen, and not come bothering here
every hour in the day. The child is that
greedy, he do eat himself mostly ill every
day, sir, as his father would be uneasy if he
knew it, sir. And to have folks hanging
round my kitchen when I am busy is a thing
I never could abide, Mr. John, as you know
very well, sir, and I hope you'll excuse me for
speaking out; and if you'd go along, sir, and
be so kind, maybe I could get through my
cleaning so as to have dinner not above half
an hour or so late, though I'm doubtful myself,
harried as I have been."</p>

<p>"I really don't see what I am to do with
Frances," said Mr. Montfort, as he went back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
to his study; "she grows more and more impracticable.
She will be giving me notice to
quit one of these days, if I don't mind. I
am very sure the house belongs to her, and
not to me. But, until Master Gerald Merryweather
comes back, I really don't see how I
am to find out who worked that roarer."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>PEACE.</h3>


<p>Peace reigned once more at Fernley House;
peace and cheerfulness, and much joy. It
was not the same peace as of old, when Margaret
and her uncle lived their quiet t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te
life, and nothing came to break the even
calm of the days. Very different was the life
of to-day. The peace was spiritual purely, for
the lively and varied round of daily life gave
little time for repose and meditation, at least
for Margaret. She had begun to give the
children short but regular lessons in the morning,
finding that the day was not only more
profitable but pleasanter for them and for all,
if it began with a little study. And the lessons
were a delight to her. Remembering her
struggles with Peggy,&mdash;dear Peggy,&mdash;it was
a joy to teach these young creatures the begin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>nings
of her beloved English history, and to
see how they leaped at it, even as she herself
had leaped so few years ago. They carried it
about with them all day. Margaret never
knew whom to expect to dinner in these days.
Now a scowling potentate would stalk in with
folded arms and announce that he was William
the Conqueror, and demand the whereabouts of
Hereward the Wake (who was pretty sure to
emerge from under the table, and engage in
sanguinary combat, just after he had brushed
his hair, and have to be sent up to the nursery
to brush it over again); now a breathless pair
would rush in, crying that they were the
Princes in the Tower, and would she please
save them, for that horrid old beast of a Gloster
was coming after them just as fast as he
could come. Indeed, Margaret had to make
a rule that they should be their own selves,
and no one else, in the evening when Uncle
John came home, for fear of more confusion
than he would like.</p>

<p>"But I get so <i>used</i> to being Richard," cried
Basil, after a day of crusader-life. "You can't
do a king well if you have to keep stopping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
and being a boy half the time. Don't you see
that yourself, Cousin Margaret?"</p>

<p>Yes, Margaret saw that, but she submitted
that she liked boys, and that it was trying for
a person in private life, like herself, to live all
day in royal society, especially when royalty
was so excited as the Majesty of England was
at this juncture.</p>

<p>"Oh, but why can't you be some one too,
Cousin Margaret? I suppose Susan D. would
hate to give up being Berengaria, after you
gave her that lovely gold veil&mdash;I say, doesn't
she look bul&mdash;doesn't she look pretty in it?
I never thought Susan D. would come out
pretty, but it's mostly the way you do her
hair&mdash;what was I saying, Cousin Margaret?
Oh, yes, but there are other people you could
be, lots and lots of them. And&mdash;Merton
doesn't half do Saladin. He keeps getting
mad when I run him through the body, and I
<i>can't</i> make him understand that I don't mean
those nasty, fat, black things in ponds, when
I call him 'learned leech,' and you know he
<i>has</i> to be the leech, it says so in the 'Talisman.'
And so perhaps you would be Saladin, and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
can be Sir Kenneth, though he's too sneaky
for him, too. Or else you could be the hermit,
Cousin Margaret. Oh, do be the hermit!
Theodoric of Engedi, you know, the Flail of
the Desert, that's a splendid one to do. All
you have to do is keep jumping about and
waving something, and crying out, 'I am
Theodoric of Engedi! I am the Flail of the
Desert!' Come on, Cousin Margaret, oh, I
say, do!" And Susan D., tugging at her
cousin's gown, shouted in unison, "Oh, I say,
do, Cousin Margaret!"</p>

<p>If any one had told Margaret Montfort, three
months before this, that she would, before the
end of the summer, be capering about the garden,
waving her staff, and proclaiming herself
aloud to be the highly theatrical personage
described above, she would have opened her
eyes in gentle and rather scornful amazement.
But Margaret was learning many things in
these days, and among them the art of being
a child. Her life had been mostly spent with
older people; she had never known till now
the rapture of being a little girl, a little boy.
Now, seeing it in these bright faces, that never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
failed to grow brighter at sight of her, she felt
the joy reflected in her own face, in her own
heart; and it was good to let all the quiet,
contained maiden ways go, once in a while,
and just be a child with the children, or a
Flail of the Desert, as in the present instance.</p>

<p>John Montfort, leaning on the gate,
watched the pretty play, well pleased.
"They have done her all the good in the
world," he said to himself. "It isn't only
what she has done for them, bless her, but
for her, too, it has been a great thing. I was
selfish and stupid to think that a young creature
could go on growing to fulness, without
other young creatures about it. How will
she feel, I wonder, about their going? How
would she like&mdash;"</p>

</div>

<p>At this moment he was discovered by
Basil, who charged him with a joyous shout.
"Oh, here is Uncle John! Oh, Uncle John,
don't you want to be Saladin, please?
Here's Merton has hurt his leg and gone off
in a sulk, and I'll get you a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'scemitar'">scimitar</ins> in a
minute&mdash;it's the old sickle, and Willis says
it's so rusty you can't really do much mischief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
with it; and here's the Hermit of
Engedi, you know, and he can shout&mdash;"</p>

<p>But, alas, for the Lion-hearted! When he
turned to summon his hermit, he saw no flying
figure, brandishing a walking-stick and
crying aloud, but a demure young lady,
smoothing her hair hurriedly and shaking
out the folds of her dress, as she hastened to
meet her uncle.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" said Uncle John. "But why
did you stop, Meg? It wouldn't have been
the first time I had played Saladin, I assure
you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, uncle! I am really too much out of
breath to play any more. And besides, it is
near tea-time, and the children must go and
get ready. I will come in a moment, Susan
dear, and do your hair. Are there any letters,
Uncle John? Oh, two, from the girls; how
perfectly delightful! Oh, I must run up, but
we'll read them after tea, shall we, Uncle
John?"</p>

<p>"With all my heart, my dear; and I have
a letter, too, about which I shall want to consult
you. Go now, or Susan D. will be trying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
to braid her own hair, a thing to be
avoided, I have observed."</p>

<p>Tea over, and Mr. Montfort seated at ease
with his cigar, the children engaged in an
enchanting game of Bat (played with worn-out
umbrellas, from which the sticks had been
taken: this game is to be highly recommended
where there is space for flapping and
swooping), Margaret opened her letters; reopened
them, rather, for it must be confessed
that she had peeped into both while she was
braiding her own hair and changing her dress
for the pretty evening gown her uncle always
liked to see.</p>

<p>"Peggy is actually off for school, Uncle
John. It does not seem possible that we are
in September, and the summer really gone.
She seems in high spirits over it, dear child.
Listen!</p>

<div class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">Darling Dearest Margaret</span>:

<p>"I am going to-morrow; I waited till the last
minute, so that I could tell you the last of me. My
trunk is almost all packed, and I really think I have
done it pretty well. Thank you, ever and ever and
ever so much, for the nice things to tie up my shoes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
in. They are just lovely, and so is the shoe-bag to
hang against the wall. I mean to put away every
shoe just the very minute I take it off, and not have
them kicking about the closet floor at all, ever. And
the combing-sack! Oh, Margaret, it is a perfect
beauty! Ever so much too pretty to do my hair in,
and mother says so, too, but I shall, because you
made it for me to, and think of you all the time I am,
and&mdash;</p>

<p>"I got a little mixed there, but you will know what
I mean, dearest Margaret. Tell Uncle John I am so
perfectly delighted with the lovely ring, I don't
know <i>what</i> to <i>do</i>. Oh, Margaret, you know how I
always wanted a ring, and how I used to admire that
sapphire of Rita's; and to think of having a sapphire
ring myself&mdash;why, I can hardly believe it even now!
I couldn't go to sleep for ever so long last night, just
watching it in the moonlight. Of course I shall write
to Uncle John and thank him myself, but I couldn't
wait just to let him know how happy I was. (Margaret,
if you think he would like it, or at least
wouldn't mind it, you might give him a hug just now
and say I sent it, but don't unless you are <i>perfectly
sure</i> he wouldn't mind, because you know how I <i>love</i>
Uncle John, even if I am just the least bit afraid of
him, and I'm sure that is natural when you think
what a goose I am.)"</p></div>

<p>Margaret paused, laughing, to throw her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
arms around her uncle, and tell him that this
was "Peggy's hug;" then she went on:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I was so glad to get your last letter, and to hear
all about dear, darling Fernley, and Uncle John, and
Elizabeth and Frances, and all the funny things those
funny children have been doing. Margaret, they are
almost exactly like us children when we were their
age. I never began to think about growing up till
I read about how they carry on, and then saw that
we didn't act so any more, Jean, and Flora, and I.
Jean is younger than me, of course, but she's more
grown up, I really think. I think you must have
a lovely time, now that&mdash;well, you said I mustn't
call names, and so I won't, but I know just exactly
what kind of a person she was, Margaret, and <i>so do
you</i>, and you can't deny it, so now!</p>

<p>"Margaret, of course I do feel rather scared about
school, for I am still very ignorant, and I suppose all
the girls will know about forty thousand times as
much as I do, and they will call me stupid, and I
know I am; but I mean to be brave, and remember
all the things you have said, and mother has helped
me, too, oh, a lot, and she says she just wishes she
had had the chance when she was a girl, and I know
now just how she feels. And then when I come
home, you see, I can teach the little girls, and that
will be great. But I never shall try to teach them
spelling, or history, for you know I cannot; and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
cannot remember to this day who Thomas &agrave; Bucket
was, and why they called him that.</p>

<p>"Hugh came in just now, and I asked him that,
and he laughed, and said Thomas &agrave; Bucket was certainly
pale before they got through with him. I
don't know what he means, but he says you will, so
I write it down. Good-bye, dearest, darling Margaret.
Give heaps and oceans and lots of love to Uncle
John, and most of all to your own darling self, from</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">Peggy.</span>"<br />
</div>
</div>

<p>"I wonder how Peggy will get on at
school?" said Margaret. "Very well, I
should think. Certainly no one can help
liking her, dear girl; and she will learn a
great deal, I am sure."</p>

<p>"She'll never learn English history," said
Mr. Montfort; "but after all, there are other
things, May Margaret, though you are loth
to acknowledge it."</p>

<p>"And now for Rita. I'll just run through
it again, Uncle John, to see&mdash;oh! oh, yes!
The first part is all just that she wants to see
me, and so on,&mdash;her wild way. She has had
the most wonderful summer,&mdash;'the Pyrenees,
Margaret! Never before have I seen great
mountains, that scale the heavens, you understand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
The Titans are explained to me. I
have seen, and my soul has arisen to their
height. I could dwell with thee, Marguerite,
on snow-peaks tinged with morning rose,
peaks that touch the stars, that veil themselves
in clouds of evening;' perhaps I'll
skip a little here, Uncle John. Interlaken,&mdash;the
Jungfrau,&mdash;oh, she <i>is</i> having a glorious
time. Oh! oh, dear me, uncle!"</p>

<p>"Well, my dear? She has not fallen off
the Jungfrau?"</p>

<p>"No, not that; but she&mdash;she is&mdash;or she
thinks she is&mdash;going to be married."</p>

<p>Mr. Montfort whistled. "To the Matterhorn,
or to some promising young avalanche?
Pray enlighten me, my dear."</p>

<p>"Oh! don't laugh, Uncle John, I am afraid
it may be serious. A young Cuban, she says,
a soldier, of course." Margaret ran her eyes
down the page, but found nothing sober
enough to read aloud. "He seems to be a
very wonderful person," she said, timidly.
"Handsome, and a miracle of courage,&mdash;and
a military genius; if war should come, Rita
thinks he will be commander-in-chief of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Cuban army. You don't think it will really
come to war, Uncle John?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell, Margaret," said Mr. Montfort,
gravely. "Things are looking rather
serious, but no one can see just what is coming
yet. And this seems to be a bona fide engagement?
It isn't little Fernando, is it?"</p>

<p>"No! oh, no! She says&mdash;she is sorry for
Fernando, but he will always be her brother.
This one's name is&mdash;let me see. Jos&eacute; Maria
Salvador Santillo de Santayana. What a magnificent
name! He had followed her from
Cuba, and he has Uncle Richard's permission
to pay his addresses to Rita, and she says&mdash;she
says he is the dream of her life, embodied
in the form of a Greek hero, with the soul of
a poet, and the intellect of a Shakespeare. So
I suppose it is all right, uncle; only, she is
very young."</p>

<p>"Young! My dear child, she was grown
up while you were still in the nursery," said
Mr. Montfort. "According to Spanish ideas,
it is high time for her to be married, and I
am sure I wish the dear girl all happiness.
We must look over the family trinkets,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Margaret, and find something for our bird
of Paradise. There are some pretty bits of
jewelry; but that will keep. Now, if you
can stop wondering and romancing for a
moment, May Margaret, I, too, have a letter,
about which I wish to consult you."</p>

<p>"Yes, uncle, oh, yes! I hope he is good
as well as handsome, don't you? She says
the Santillo nose is the marvel of all Cuba."</p>

<p>"The Santillo nose may be pickled in brine,
my dear, for ought I care; I really want your
attention, Margaret, and you must come down
from the clouds. Here is Anthony Montfort
writing for his children."</p>

<p>"<i>What!</i>" cried Margaret, waking suddenly
from her dream. "What did you say about
the children, Uncle John? Cousin Anthony
writing for them? What can you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, my love, I mean writing for them,"
said Mr. Montfort, calmly. "He is, you may
remember, a relation of theirs, a father in
point of fact. He has found an excellent
opening in California, and means to stay
there. He says&mdash;I'll read you his letter, or
the part of it that relates to the children.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Hum&mdash;'grateful to you'&mdash;ha! yes, here it
is. 'Of course I must make some arrangement
about the children. One of the boys
can come to me, but I cannot take care of
both, so Basil will have to go to boarding-school,
and Susan D., too. If you would be
so good as to look up a good school or two, I
should be ever so much obliged. Basil can
take care of himself, you'll only have to consign
and ship him; perhaps you can get some
one to go with the little girl, and see to her
things and all that. It's a shame to call upon
you,'&mdash;h'm! so forth! Well, Meg, what do
you say?"</p>

<p>But Margaret said nothing. She was sitting
with her hands fallen on her lap, gazing
at her uncle with a face of such piteous consternation
that he had much ado to keep his
countenance.</p>

<p>"Take them away!" she faltered, presently.
"Take away&mdash;my children? Oh, Uncle
John!"</p>

<p>Mr. Montfort looked away, and smoked
awhile in silence, giving the girl time to collect
herself. Margaret struggled with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
tears that wanted to rush to her eyes. She
forced herself to take up the letters that lay
in her lap and fold them methodically. When
he saw that her hands trembled less, Mr.
Montfort said, quietly, "The children have
been a great deal of care to you, Margaret;
but you have grown fond of them, I know,
and so have I. I think a good deal of your
judgment, my dear, young as you are. What
would you like best to have done about the
little people? Take time; take time! Anthony
practically leaves the whole matter in
my hands. In fact, I think he is puzzled,
and feels perhaps that he has not done as well
as he might for them always. Take time, my
child."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't need any time, Uncle John!"
cried Margaret, trying to speak steadily. "I&mdash;I
didn't realise, I suppose&mdash;it has all come
about so gradually&mdash;I didn't realise all that
they were to me. To lose Basil and Susan
D.,&mdash;I don't see how I can let them go,
uncle; I don't indeed. You won't think me
ungrateful, will you, dear? I was, oh, so
happy, before they came; but now&mdash;they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
are so dear, so dear! and&mdash;and Susan D. is
used to me, and to have her go to a stranger
who might not understand the poor little
shut-up nature&mdash;oh, how can I bear it? how
can I bear it?"</p>

<p>"Well, my dear," said Mr. Montfort, comfortably.
"How if you did not have to bear
it?"</p>

<p>Then, as Margaret raised her startled eyes
to his, he went on, in the kind, steady tone
that always brought quiet and peace with
it.</p>

<p>"How if we made the present arrangement&mdash;part
of it, at least&mdash;permanent?
Let Merton go to his father; I should not care
to have the bringing up of Merton. But there
is an excellent school near here, on the island,
to which Basil could go, staying the week
and coming home here for Sunday; and if
little Susan would not be too much care for
you,&mdash;she's a dear little girl, once you get
through the prickles,&mdash;why, May Margaret,
it seems to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Mr. Montfort got no further; for
here was Margaret sobbing on his breast as if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
she were Rita herself, and calling him the
best and dearest and kindest, and telling him
that she was so happy, so happy; and that
was why she was crying, only she could not
stop; and so on and so on, till Uncle John
really thought he should have to send for
Frances. At his suggesting this, however,
Margaret laughed through her tears, and
presently struggled into something like composure.</p>

<p>"And, after all," said Mr. Montfort, "how
do you know the children will want to stay
with you, you conceited young woman?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle John! I will teach Susan D.
all I know, and a great deal more, I hope, for
I shall be learning all the time now, if I have
another coming after me. And we will keep
house together, and it will be like the little
sister, like little Penelope, Uncle John. And
then to have Basil coming home every week,
all full of school, and fun, and noise,&mdash;why,
how perfectly delightful it will be!
And I will not let them overrun you, dear
uncle; they have been good lately, haven't
they?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>"They have been extremely good, my dear.
All the same, I think you would do well to
interview them on the subject, before you
prepare all your chickens for the market.
See, there are your two coming up the walk
this moment. You might go&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Margaret was already gone. Mr.
Montfort watched her light figure flying
down the walk, and thought she had grown
almost back into a child again, since the
children came. "And yet all a woman," he
said; "all a sweet, wholesome, gentle woman.
See her now with her arms around the child;
the little creature clings to her as if she were
the mother it never knew. Ah! she is telling
them. No need to smother her, children.
I never really meant to separate you; no,
indeed. I only wanted you to find out for
yourselves, as I have found out for myself.
No more solitude at Fernley, please God;
from now on, young faces and hearts, and
sunshine, and a home; the future instead of
the past."</p>

<p>The good man laid down his cigar, quietly
and carefully, as he did everything, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
opened his arms as the three, Margaret and
her children, came flying towards him; and
they ran into those kind strong arms and
nestled there, and looked into his eyes and
knew that they were at home.</p>
